Share Sustainability Certifications What is B Corp Certification? Akepa on February 18, 2025 Buying nectar low, selling honey high, getting all your mindless drones to do all the work while you buzz around wearing a tiny little necktie? That’s a bee corporation and, while very sustainable, it’s a very crowded market and usually requires you to be a bee. So if you’re a human reading this, you’re out of luck. However, a better option for humans in business is to consider becoming B Corp certified. What is a B Corp? Think of a B Corp as being to business what Fair Trade is to bananas. It’s a public commitment to “meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose.” It’s saying to the public ‘we’re trying to be better, to reduce harm across the environment, society, and in business and we’ve got the certificate to prove it’. It’s about shifting the focus away from profit and towards purpose"
3,AKEPA,1597,".” It’s saying to the public ‘we’re trying to be better, to reduce harm across the environment, society, and in business and we’ve got the certificate to prove it’. It’s about shifting the focus away from profit and towards purpose. Unlike some other initiatives, there’s an independent body that assesses whether a business meets the right criteria to make that claim. B Lab is a not-for-profit organisation that awards B Corp status to for-profit businesses and it doesn’t seem to give it out too hastily. There are brands that you would expect to be B Corp certified like Patagonia but also brands that are less obviously connected to the world of sustainability like The Guardian Media Group and Ben & Jerry’s. Note that B Corp is different from Benefit Corporation. Why be B Corped? Why bother? Of course, you can be a sustainable business without being B Corp certified but in a world where “…the majority of Generation Z (54 percent) state that they are willing to spend an incremental 10 percent or more on sustainable products, with 50 percent of Millennials saying the same” a certification means that your customers don’t have to just take you at your word. It gives them the peace of mind that your business is legitimately doing something to make the world a bit better. And aside from the potential commercial and marketing benefits, it can create a movement. If enough businesses get certified it can become an expectation. In time, it may start to look like a big mark against a business if they’re not certified, which may raise questions about why they’ve not yet been accredited"
4,AKEPA,1577,". And aside from the potential commercial and marketing benefits, it can create a movement. If enough businesses get certified it can become an expectation. In time, it may start to look like a big mark against a business if they’re not certified, which may raise questions about why they’ve not yet been accredited. If it means that they have to change their working practices, then all the better. It can also attract the right kind of talent to your business. More and more graduates are ethically minded, wanting to work for organisation who are doing good, so having the B Corp seal of approval can be a big tick for new recruits. Are there alternatives? Yes and no. You can follow these tips and choose from an array of other certifications to confirm your commitment to an aspect of sustainability or decide to use other ways to meet the same B Corp goals. We decided to address our corporate emissions and that’s accredited by ClimatePartner. Still, these approaches differ a bit from becoming a B Corp, which is about the balancing of profit and purpose overall. It’s not just about one element and it’s not just about climate change. In a way, it’s more about ethics. How do I get accredited? There are a few steps to go through to become B Corp certified. First, you’ve got to qualify as the right kind of business. B Lab ask that you generate the majority of your revenue from trading and compete in a competitive marketplace. They don’t generally allow registered charities or public bodies to apply but apparently do take each registration on a case-by-case basis"
5,AKEPA,1505,". First, you’ve got to qualify as the right kind of business. B Lab ask that you generate the majority of your revenue from trading and compete in a competitive marketplace. They don’t generally allow registered charities or public bodies to apply but apparently do take each registration on a case-by-case basis. If you qualify, you need to take an online assessment. This is a long questionnaire that asks about 7 key impact areas*: Purpose & Stakholder Governance Fair Work Justice, Equity, Diversity & Inclusion Human Rights Climate Action Environmental Stewardship & Circularity Government Affairs & Collective Action You must meet minimum performance requirements across each area. Do that, and you’re onto the next step – certification. This is where a B Lab staffer will meet with you virtually to go through your answers, ask further questions and confidentially review documentation that can back up your claims. And finally, you’ve got to pay. There is an initial verification fee and then an annual certification fee. B Lab runs a sliding scale of fees depending on the size of your business. However, even at the lowest tiers the overall fees run to several thousand dollars per year (or pounds / euros etc.). It’s fairly expensive. And crucially, certification only lasts three years, after which you’ll need to go through the process again to prove that you’re keeping up the good work. As of June 2024, all updated paperwork needs to be submitted six months before the recertification date"
6,AKEPA,834,".). It’s fairly expensive. And crucially, certification only lasts three years, after which you’ll need to go through the process again to prove that you’re keeping up the good work. As of June 2024, all updated paperwork needs to be submitted six months before the recertification date. *New standards are being rolled-out in 2025 and these are the new impact areas, which have been amended and increased from 5. The requirement of an overall score of 80 is also being changed to a performance-based system. Are there downsides? Not especially. Make sure that you give serious consideration to your motivations before applying. Becoming B Corp certified needs to be more than a PR move. Only one in three companies that submit for certification will actually certify. Is your business ready to have its practices rigorously examined?"

11,AKEPA,1404,". From the 6, their Standard 100 is the most popular, where they make sure that a product is entirely free from over 100 substances that are harmful to people and the environment. It ensures that end-products (every single part of it) are free from harmful chemicals. Others focus more on working conditions, such as Made in Green, but are said to be not as strict ‚Äì e.g. child labor isn‚Äôt prohibited. OEKO-TEX should not be confused with organic; it simply tests for consumer safety and doesn‚Äôt investigate into raw materials. Their criteria are reviewed every year, and they operate on global standards. They also regularly update their certifications and introduce new ones. Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) Accredited by: GOTS and third-party GOTS-accredited certification bodies Used for: textiles Examples of brands with certified products: PACT, Organic Basics, Brook There GOTS is the leading certification for organic textiles, a classic example being for cotton. It is one of the most relevant sustainability certifications in the fashion industry. To be GOTS-certified, a product has to prove to be at least 70% organic*, and the entire supply chain and manufacturing is monitored. There are strict controls on chemicals used, water and energy waste, as well as the treatment of workers. It‚Äôs internationally recognized as one of the toughest organic textile standards to achieve"

There are strict controls on chemicals used, water and energy waste, as well as the treatment of workers. It‚Äôs internationally recognized as one of the toughest organic textile standards to achieve. We‚Äôre big fans of this one and a few of our sustainable fashion clients swear by it! *They have two label grades: ‚Äòorganic‚Äô requires a minimum of 95% organic fibres and ‚Äòmade with organic materials‚Äô requires at least 70% organic fibres. Responsible Wool Standard (RWS) Accredited by: Textile Exchange Used for: wool products Examples of brands with certified products: Patagonia, H&M, REI, ASKET RWS is a voluntary global standard created by Textile Exchange to progressively improve the welfare of sheep and the land they graze on, from farmer to final product. The standard recognizes better farm-level practices such as handling, nutrition, shearing, medical treatments, and sustainable grazing methods. Mulesing of sheep is prohibited. However, RWS does allow painful practices such as castration and tail docking, which is when sheep have their tails cut or burnt off ‚Äì with pain relief not mandatory. Further, the standard allows sheep to be sold to slaughterhouses and does not address off-farm slaughter or inhumane transportation"

However, RWS does allow painful practices such as castration and tail docking, which is when sheep have their tails cut or burnt off ‚Äì with pain relief not mandatory. Further, the standard allows sheep to be sold to slaughterhouses and does not address off-farm slaughter or inhumane transportation. ZQ Merino Wool Certified Accredited by: The New Zealand Merino Company (NZM) Used for: wool farms Examples of brands with certified products: Allbirds, Smartwool, Fj√§llr√§ven Note: NZM and Textile Exchange have worked together to create a combined audit process, so any farm with a ZQ certification will automatically receive RWS certification. The ZQ certification is considered the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù for traceable wool. It is meant to ensure the welfare of animals and people in the production of merino wool, mainly in New Zealand. ZQ now also have a regenerative wool project called ZQRX. Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) Accredited by: Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) Used for: brands (and not products) Examples of certified brands: H&M, ASOS, Urban Outfitters Better Cotton is a non-profit organisation advocating for better practices within cotton communities. They aim to reduce the negative impacts of cotton growing and processing. But they have come under scrutiny for a variety of reasons including using GMO, non-organic cotton, and forced labour in China. Many BCI members are global fast-fashion brands like H&M, who have had their sustainability claims questioned overall"

But they have come under scrutiny for a variety of reasons including using GMO, non-organic cotton, and forced labour in China. Many BCI members are global fast-fashion brands like H&M, who have had their sustainability claims questioned overall. Biodiversity Wildlife Trust‚Äôs Biodiversity Benchmark Used for: land-owning businesses Examples of brands with certified products: Toyota, The Met Office, Heathrow Airport Biodiversity Benchmark was designed to complement ISO14001 and is allegedly the only standard that certifies the management of a business site for wildlife. It provides a framework within which an organization can ensure its impact is as positive as it can be by providing robust, independent verification of land management practices. Certified sites can enhance biodiversity in several ways: restoring (proactive management of existing wildlife-rich sites and sites of conservation importance), recreation (establishment of wildlife habitat on land previously used for other purposes), and reconnection (sites that contribute towards a network of habitats). Animal Welfare Leaping Bunny (Leaping Bunny Program in the US and Canada and Cruelty Free International globally) Accredited by: Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics (CCIC) Used for: cosmetics, personal care, household products Examples of brands with certified products: Dr. Bronners, E.l.f"
15,AKEPA,1454,". Animal Welfare Leaping Bunny (Leaping Bunny Program in the US and Canada and Cruelty Free International globally) Accredited by: Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics (CCIC) Used for: cosmetics, personal care, household products Examples of brands with certified products: Dr. Bronners, E.l.f., JASON This nicely named certification ensures that a company does not take part in animal testing for their final product, as well as every single ingredient in that product. The company also has to implement a supplier monitoring system and has to recommit to the standards annually. Note: Brands certified cruelty-free by Leaping Bunny can be owned by a parent company that does test on animals. Brands can also still contain animal products, so this certification does not certify that a product is vegan. For vegan certifications, see the next three. Certified Vegan (Vegan Action) Accredited by: Vegan Action Used for: all kinds of products such as food, drinks, cosmetics, clothes, bags, shoes, household products Examples of brands with certified products: Oatly, Vita Coco, Hellman‚Äôs, Magnum USA-based products can be certified vegan by Vegan Action to ensure that there is not a single ingredient or component that was derived from animals, including GMOs that include animal-derived substances. For example, sweeteners can‚Äôt be processed by bone char, and alcohol products can‚Äôt have been filtered or clarified with animal products"
16,AKEPA,1488,". For example, sweeteners can‚Äôt be processed by bone char, and alcohol products can‚Äôt have been filtered or clarified with animal products. Companies must even prove ‚Äì if shared machinery is used with non-vegan products ‚Äì that machinery and surfaces were thoroughly sanitised and cleaned in between. This certification also means the product involved no animal testing. The Vegan Trademark (The Vegan Society) Accredited by: The Vegan Society Used for: all kinds of products such as food, drinks, cosmetics, clothes, bags, shoes, household products Examples of brands with certified products: Alpro, Violife, Wagamama, Burger King, LUSH The Vegan Society trademark logo is used worldwide, and with similar strictness to Vegan Action‚Äôs certification. It guarantees products are free of animal use, animal testing, animal-derived ingredients, and GMOs that have animal-derived substances or production processes. Restaurant dishes using this label should be prepared separately from non-vegan dishes. So no grilling of vegan patties right next to massive meat ones like Burger King did ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. PETA-Approved Vegan Accredited by: The PETA Foundation Used for: clothes, bags, shoes, accessories, textiles, and home decor Examples of brands with certified products: NAE Vegan Shoes, DiMare Design, Woodpecker Coats, MoEa sneakers The vegan certification by PETA (People for Ethical Treatment of Animals) ensures that a product does not contain any animal-related materials"
17,AKEPA,1511,". PETA-Approved Vegan Accredited by: The PETA Foundation Used for: clothes, bags, shoes, accessories, textiles, and home decor Examples of brands with certified products: NAE Vegan Shoes, DiMare Design, Woodpecker Coats, MoEa sneakers The vegan certification by PETA (People for Ethical Treatment of Animals) ensures that a product does not contain any animal-related materials. It can be used for products, even if other products as part of that collection are not vegan; it can be used for fully vegan collections from a brand, and it can be used to certify an entire brand. It‚Äôs not to be confused with PETA‚Äôs cruelty-free certification. Despite this vegan certification being used by over 1,000 brands, PETA has a controversial reputation. In particular, for its shocking ads, which have even been banned in some countries. As always, it‚Äôs good to be informed of the good and the bad. Upcycled Upcycled Certified Accredited by: Upcycled Food Association (UFA) Used for: food products Examples of certified brands: Hippeas, Hello! I‚Äôm Ugly, ReGrained, Noka Currently, Upcycled Certified is the only third-party certification for upcycled foods globally. Upcycled foods are defined by UFA as ‚Äúfoods that use ingredients that otherwise would not have gone to human consumption, are procured and produced using verifiable supply chains, and have a positive impact on the environment‚Äù. Looking for this certification is a great way to support brands that are using food waste to create their products"
18,AKEPA,1522,". Upcycled foods are defined by UFA as ‚Äúfoods that use ingredients that otherwise would not have gone to human consumption, are procured and produced using verifiable supply chains, and have a positive impact on the environment‚Äù. Looking for this certification is a great way to support brands that are using food waste to create their products. Recycled Global Recycled Standard (GRS) Accredited by: Textile Exchange Used for: textiles and other products Examples of brands with certified products: Tala, Nudie Jeans, Kuyichi The Global Recycled Standard verifies, through third-party certification bodies, that a product contains at least 20% recycled materials. Note that this percentage only applies to B2B products; for consumer-facing labels, products must contain a minimum of 50% recycled content. GRS also addresses supply chains, environmental and social practices, and chemical contents. Their objective is to make sure claims are accurate and working conditions are good, while also limiting the use of toxic materials. Recycled Claim Standard (RCS) Accredited by: Textile Exchange Used for: textiles and other products Examples of brands with certified products: OrthoLite, VELCRO, Genan Like the Global Recycled Standard, the Recycled Claim Standard is also run by Textile Exchange. Both standards are the same, except GRS is a more rigorous standard. RCS is intended for use with any product that contains at least 5% recycled materials and does not address social or environmental aspects of processing"
19,AKEPA,1575,". Both standards are the same, except GRS is a more rigorous standard. RCS is intended for use with any product that contains at least 5% recycled materials and does not address social or environmental aspects of processing. You may have noticed RCS has two types of logos: one that states ‚ÄúRecycled 100 Claim Standard‚Äù as shown above, and one that states ‚ÄúRecycled Blended Claim Standard‚Äù. Although Textile Exchange lacks clarity on this, many resources state that RCS 100 ensures a product contains 95-100% recycled content and RCS Blended contains a minimum of 5% recycled content. Recycled Content Certification Accredited by: SCS Global Services Used for: all kinds of products Examples of brands with certified products: Shredded Tire Inc., Revolution Bag, Numatic, GreenMantra The SCS Recycled Content Certification evaluates products made from pre-consumer or post-consumer material diverted from the waste stream and verifies the percentage of recycled materials in a product. Manufacturers obtain a numbered certificate with specified recycled material levels and a certification mark for use on products and marketing. Organic USDA Organic Accredited by: USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) Used for: food, cosmetics, skincare, textiles Examples of brands with certified products: Dole, 365 by Whole Foods Market, Kirkland Signature Despite having lost a bit of trust, the USDA Organic label still stands out due to upholding its commendable requirements, as well as extra efforts to step up and prevent organic fraud. USDA Organic certifies U.S"
20,AKEPA,1524,". USDA Organic certifies U.S. products only and demands that no synthetic pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, or GMOs (following a list of acceptable and prohibited substances) are present under every facet of the farm and business. USDA certifies organic textiles too, but only the raw, agricultural fibre ‚Äì not the finished, processed textile. Third-party certifiers carry out a yearly review and audit. That all said, the U.S. organic market has grown so big that some say the current system is not up to scratch and that it needs an overhaul. Some growing concerns are third-party certifiers not upholding all of the required standards and non-organic food being imported to the U.S. as ‚Äòorganic‚Äô. Note: USDA Organic certification does not ensure animal welfare or environmentally sustainable production. EU Organic Logo Accredited by: European Commission Used for: agricultural raw materials and food products Examples of brands with certified products: Whole Earth, Ecocesta, Natruly Contrary to all the other certifications mentioned in this post, the EU Organic logo is mandatory for pre-packaged food products produced and sold as organic in the EU. The logo is optional otherwise, such as for imported organic products. There are strict requirements for the use of this logo, for example no GMOs, transformation of waste into resources, animal welfare standards, and at least 95% of ingredients must be organic. Logos must be accompanied by the coded number of the control body that authorized certification"

There are strict requirements for the use of this logo, for example no GMOs, transformation of waste into resources, animal welfare standards, and at least 95% of ingredients must be organic. Logos must be accompanied by the coded number of the control body that authorized certification. Soil Association Accredited by: International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Used for: food, cosmetics, textiles Examples of certified brands: Salt of the Earth, Komodo, UpCircle In the UK, Soil Association certifies over 70% of organic food and drinks, making it the country‚Äôs leading organic certification body. That doesn‚Äôt just refer to Soil Association certified organic ‚Äì they also certify to other standards, including GOTS, COSMOS, and FSC. Verified by third-party auditors and holding the international standard ISO17065 accreditation, Soil Association promises to operate in a ‚Äòconsistent and reliable‚Äô manner. Soil Association‚Äôs certified products are legally required to meet EU Organic‚Äôs regulations, plus their own higher standards.

22,AKEPA,1326,". Soil Association‚Äôs certified products are legally required to meet EU Organic‚Äôs regulations, plus their own higher standards. You can find their logo on certified products for easy identification. Climate Action Climate neutrality works best in combination with efforts to keep emissions low in first place. Here are a few key certifications in the area: The Climate Label Accredited by: The Change Climate Project (TCCP) Used for: brands (and not products), and some non-brand entities Examples of certified brands (Climate Neutral Certified): Klean Kanteen, Pela, Wolven Note: Starting 2025, The Climate Label will replace the Climate Neutral Certified label, so we‚Äôve precedently made the change in this article. Further, the organization ‚ÄòClimate Neutral‚Äô has also changed to ‚ÄòThe Change Climate Project‚Äô (TCCP). The Change Climate Project is a nonprofit working to eliminate carbon emissions and certifies companies according to The Climate Label 2025 Standard. The Climate Label certification will now be moving beyond neutrality. The new approach will involve an internal carbon fee, and the certification will be based on an examination of active corporate funding of carbon-reducing projects. Climate Partner Accredited by: Climate Partner / T√úV Austria Used for: brands, packaging, and products (e.g"
23,AKEPA,1552,". The Climate Label certification will now be moving beyond neutrality. The new approach will involve an internal carbon fee, and the certification will be based on an examination of active corporate funding of carbon-reducing projects. Climate Partner Accredited by: Climate Partner / T√úV Austria Used for: brands, packaging, and products (e.g. print products, hotel stays, food and beverage) Examples of certified brands: Canon, Lavera, LEON, Akepa After assessing a company‚Äôs current emissions, Climate Partner offers five solutions: a corporate carbon footprint for companies, a product carbon footprint for a product or service, a carbon emission reduction strategy, carbon offsetting to achieve climate neutrality, and communicating these commitments. Akepa uses Climate Partner to understand and offset carbon emissions but we also try to keep those very low in the first place through strategies like our 100% remote working model. Gold Standard Accredited by: UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Used for: projects Examples of certified projects: Improved cookstoves for Ugandan families, sustainable afforestation in Togo, clean water access in India Established by the World Wildlife Fund and other NGOs, the Gold Standard is not for brands or products, but rather for projects to quantify, certify, and maximise their impact. It is a carbon offset program that is focused on progressing the United Nations‚Äô Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and they must follow the Gold Standard for the Global Goals‚Äô requirements"
24,AKEPA,1600,". It is a carbon offset program that is focused on progressing the United Nations‚Äô Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and they must follow the Gold Standard for the Global Goals‚Äô requirements. They are rigorously screened for true environmental impact through UN-accredited independent auditors, and they require the involvement of local stakeholders and NGOs. Agriculture Certified Regenerative by AGW Accredited by: A Greener World (AGW) Used for: plant- and animal-based food, textiles, personal care products Examples of certified brands: Zack‚Äôs Mighty, a2 Milk, Park Farming Organics Certified Regenerative by AGW covers all aspects of regenerative agriculture such as soil quality, healthier and more biodiverse ecosystems, and cleaner air and water ‚Äì plus, better treatment of workers and animals. This standard takes a 360-degree view of the whole farm. While organic is not required, Certified Regenerative incorporates their Certified Animal Welfare Approved standards. Regenerative Organic Certified (ROC) Accredited by: Regenerative Organic Alliance (ROA) Used for: food, textiles, personal care products Examples of certified brands: Dr. Bronner‚Äôs, Outerknown, Whole Foods Market, Lotus Foods This standard is about shifting the global food system into one that respects land and animals, empowers people, and restores communities and ecosystems. Regenerative Organic Certified uses the USDA organic certification as a baseline but fills in the gaps by incorporating the three pillars of regenerative organic agriculture: soil health, animal welfare, and farmworker fairness"
25,AKEPA,1580,". Regenerative Organic Certified uses the USDA organic certification as a baseline but fills in the gaps by incorporating the three pillars of regenerative organic agriculture: soil health, animal welfare, and farmworker fairness. With the goal of preventing the greenwashing of the word ‚Äòregenerative‚Äô, the ROC combined ‚Äòregenerative‚Äô with ‚Äòorganic‚Äô as the ROA believe they should always go together. Fair Trade Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) Accredited by: Assurance Services International (ASI) Used for: areas and companies involved in palm oil production Examples of brands with certified products: Danone, PepsiCo, Unilever, Nestl√© Palm oil is in half of supermarket products. Yet, when grown unsustainably, it‚Äôs a major driver of deforestation of some of the world‚Äôs most biodiverse forests. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is focused on bringing together stakeholders from across the palm oil supply chain ‚Äì such as palm oil producers or traders, retailers, banks, and NGOs ‚Äì to make ‚Äòsustainable‚Äô palm oil. That is, according to RSPO, ‚Äúpalm oil that has been farmed, processed, distributed, and sold responsibly with strict rules that protect animals, the environment, and people who live and work in palm oil producing countries.‚Äù As we‚Äôve been objective with all the certifications mentioned, we must note that RSPO has been under considerable scrutiny. The RSPO label has been rejected for years by many environmental, social, and human rights organizations around the world for being fraudulent and greenwashing"
26,AKEPA,1400,".‚Äù As we‚Äôve been objective with all the certifications mentioned, we must note that RSPO has been under considerable scrutiny. The RSPO label has been rejected for years by many environmental, social, and human rights organizations around the world for being fraudulent and greenwashing. Various reports and case studies show that RSPO-certified plantations have been involved in forced labor and land conflict with local communities and that RSPO does not truly enable sustainable palm oil, instead allowing deforestation. PEFC Used for: sustainable forest management Examples of brands with certified products: HEMA, The Green Factory, Pepe Garden Furniture PEFC, the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, is a global alliance of national forest certification systems, NGOs, associations, companies, and individuals that promotes sustainable forest management through independent third-party certification. Anyone in the forest and wood industry, such as a forest owner or a company within the forest supply chain, can obtain the PEFC label. PEFC certification follows two processes: sustainable forest management, which has three domains ‚Äì environmental, economic, and social, and chain of custody, which tracks forest-based products from sustainable sources to the final product. Products can only carry a PEFC label if they contain a minimum of 70% PEFC-certified material"

Products can only carry a PEFC label if they contain a minimum of 70% PEFC-certified material. Fair to Folk Fairtrade Accredited by: FLOCERT Used for: mainly food & beverages Examples of brands with certified products: Ben & Jerry‚Äôs, Clipper Tea, Nespresso The Fairtrade certification is among the most well-known and ubiquitous. Their goal is to empower workers and farmers, and promote fair pay. They check compliance of standards through audits by independent certifiers, including that producers are paid their premiums. You‚Äôve likely seen this little insignia on something or the other but it‚Äôs come under some scrutiny. You can read more in depth about some of the complaints here and here. At the same time though, there are also plenty of people defending the certification. And it remains very popular.

Based on internationally recognized standards of decent work, the nine elements of its framework judge performance on issues such as child labour, forced labour, health and safety, discrimination, and working hours. However, there are shortcomings associated with SA8000, the biggest one being that almost 300 garment factory workers lost their lives in a factory fire. The factory had just recently been certified by SA8000.

Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) Accredited by: Assurance Services International (ASI) Used for: fisheries Examples of brands with certified products: Walmart, Bumble Bee, Lidl The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) is a counterpart to ASC, but assesses wild capture fisheries to see if they are well-managed and sustainable. They‚Äôre assessed by accredited independent certifiers under 3 core principles: sustainable fish stocks, minimizing environmental impact, and effective fisheries management. MSC has received some backlash, though ‚Äì a quick Google search will yield many different sources stating their reasons why. For starters, fisheries that have not yet achieved the sustainability standards can still get certified. MSC also certifies bottom trawling, which is an unsustainable practice that promotes overfishing, as it crudely drags a net along the seafloor ‚Äì indiscriminately capturing everything fishy that was unlucky enough to be in wrong place at the wrong time"

The Forest Stewardship Council aims to set the world-leading forest management standards, for example prohibiting deforestation, protecting ecological values and endangered species, and restricting the use of hazardous pesticides. There are certified assessment bodies to carry out audits for companies. It‚Äôs a respected certification but the credibility of the FSC has come under some criticism for somehow failing to protect forests, for reasons including illegally harvested wood and little to no effect on tropical deforestation.

Compostability Label by European Bioplastics Accredited by: T√úV Austria and DIN CERTCO Used for: packaging of products Examples of brands with certified products: GoZero, Scrummi, If You Care Biodegradable refers to material that breaks down naturally with microorganisms in the presence of oxygen and light. Compostable refers to material that breaks down under a human-driven, compost environment, the end result being soil. Items can be compostable either in a home compost, industrial compost, or both. Everything that‚Äôs compostable is also biodegradable, but not everything that‚Äôs biodegradable is compostable. And neither of the two will be able to break down in landfill. This compostability label by European Bioplastics refers to being industrially compostable according to the European standard EN13432. This logo tells buyers that the packaging of a product will break down, as long as it was disposed of correctly in order to be composted industrially. According to EN13432, certified compostable items are checked and verified to fully biodegrade into water, biomass, and CO2 under controlled conditions such as temperature, moisture, and time frame, leaving behind no harmful substances.

There are 3 different certification levels: Certified Member (working towards certification with 50% of criteria met), Gold Member (certified members of 5 consecutive years), and Platinum Member (certified members of 10 consecutive years). Overall, this certification has a good reputation but in 2000, the Worldwide Fund for Nature heavily criticized the standard (when it was still called Green Globe 21) for being misleading and lacking credibility, in an independent analysis of tourism certifications. However, as this was over 20 years ago, the findings may not be valid anymore.

Products receive an achievement level (basic, bronze, silver, gold, or platinum) in each of the 5 categories, with the lowest achievement level representing the product‚Äôs overall mark.

While they serve a vital purpose in controlling pests and safeguarding yields, their negative consequences are not to be taken lightly. Cotton farming accounts for 4.7% of the world’s pesticide and 10% of its insecticides sales. According to one study, around 44% of farmers are poisoned by pesticides every year. With IPM, the presence of pests does not automatically lead to the use of control measures, and when control measures are necessary, non-chemical methods such as biopesticides or traps are the first choice — conventional pesticides are a last resort. By 2030, we want to reduce the use and risk of synthetic pesticides applied by Better Cotton Farmers and workers by at least 50%."
68,Better_Cotton,1304,"Organisation: Better Cotton URL: https://bettercotton.org/ Page Title: sustainability issues - water stewardship  About half a billion people around the world currently face severe water scarcity, and nearly half of the global population lives in regions where freshwater is polluted. Caring for our water resources — both locally and globally — is one of the biggest sustainability challenges of our times. At Better Cotton, we believe that solutions require a water stewardship approach where individual and collective actions benefit both people and nature. Cotton is a relatively drought tolerant crop and is entirely rainfed in many regions where it grows. However, approximately half of its production area requires some sort of irrigation, and as freshwater becomes an increasingly scarce and precious resource, it is critical to ensure it is used in sustainable ways. By implementing sustainable farming practices, farmers can learn how to use water efficiently on both rainfed and irrigated farms to achieve greater yields and consume and pollute less water. This not only contributes to more sustainable water use but also helps farmers improve their livelihoods and build resilience to climate change — something that will become increasingly important as pressure on water supply intensifies."

We recognise that Better Cotton is only ‘better’ if it improves the wellbeing of farmers and their communities, fostering decent work opportunities for rural populations, as well as promoting a safe and healthy environment. Cotton Production and Decent Work — Why it Matters: More than 70% of global cotton is produced by smallholder farmers.

75,Clean_Clothes_Campaign,1382,"What’s better than brands’ giving their word on how things will improve for the workers with voluntary agreements? A legally binding agreement that holds brands accountable by a court of law. About a decade after the adoption of the UN Guiding Principles (UNGP), it is clear that reliance on a voluntary framework has proven insufficient and ineffective for workers and the broader society. While various voluntary initiatives have been established from safety to wages and then some, research repeatedly reveals devastating facts. Working conditions and workers’ lives have not improved and the garment industry remains marred by endemic human rights violations and systematic exploitation. Systemic patterns of human rights violations in the companies’ value chains speak volumes of a lack of systematic and meaningful Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) practice. Violations of freedom of association, poverty wages, even with extensive overtime, occupational health and safety issues, and gender-based discrimination and violence are frequently documented in numerous brands’ and retailers’ value chains – despite their public commitments that they would prevent such human and labour rights abuses. Neither non-judicial grievance mechanisms nor social auditing, certification schemes, or various (other) responsible business initiatives have had the impact touted at their launch"
76,Clean_Clothes_Campaign,1411,". Neither non-judicial grievance mechanisms nor social auditing, certification schemes, or various (other) responsible business initiatives have had the impact touted at their launch. Workers risk their lives to make T-shirts in crumbling buildings, many send their children to sleep hungry despite working 12, even 16-hour shifts, and many cannot even stay with their families because the cost of living near their workplace is prohibitive on poverty wages that workers are still being paid. Most of these workers being women, they also witness, and many experience, gender based violence and discrimination. Clothing companies have responded to outside criticism of labour rights violations in their supply chains by promising to do better. Many use these voluntary commitments as a selling point, trying to signal that theirs is a socially conscious company. The lofty Codes of Conduct and sugar coated public commitments since worker exploitation in outsourced factories was first widely exposed, in the 1990s, evaporated into thin air as soon as consumers’ gaze turned away. As Clean Clothes Campaign, we are an active member in various coalitions and initiatives that ask for strong legislation. Legislation that will guarantee the right to remedy when workers' rights are violated, that will ensure there is liability for the whole supply chain, and that includes climate and environmental considerations"
77,Clean_Clothes_Campaign,1469,". As Clean Clothes Campaign, we are an active member in various coalitions and initiatives that ask for strong legislation. Legislation that will guarantee the right to remedy when workers' rights are violated, that will ensure there is liability for the whole supply chain, and that includes climate and environmental considerations. We believe there will be a need for legislation on various levels: a UN Binding Treaty, a strong EU legislation that includes special provisions for high-risk sectors like the garment industry, and national-level initiatives that can take further measures. We want garment companies to clean up their act and the whole industry, and to do so now. Workers have waited far too long, with brands’ promises going unmet. As a first step, we ask for binding agreements signed by brands and applicable at their supplier workplaces. We want to see a series of enforceable supply chain agreements that will address specific issues within the supply chain. We want them to specify concrete measures as well as enforcement, supervision, complaint mechanisms and remedy. These agreements are legally binding contracts that can be upheld in a court of law so brands cannot make promises that nobody holds them accountable for. They are voluntary in that garment brands individually opt in rather than face a legal requirement to sign on. These agreements create legal commitments, and if they are violated, brands can find themselves in courtrooms"

They are voluntary in that garment brands individually opt in rather than face a legal requirement to sign on. These agreements create legal commitments, and if they are violated, brands can find themselves in courtrooms. Examples of agreements that are a result of this strategy are the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh and the Freedom of Association Protocol in Indonesia. The latest such agreement addresses gender-based violence at factories in Lesotho, in the wake of Workers Rights Consortium’s investigation and subsequent negotiation with key buyers. Next, we want to see enforceable supply chain agreements on wages. We want due diligence to be a matter of regulatory compliance with not only clear enforcement mechanisms but also effective remedies. Human rights violations should be a matter of urgency for the garment and sportswear industry, it's time stakeholders work together to eradicate them from the supply chain. Companies have a lot of money to spend on presenting their toothless measures as social consciousness, and many consumers buy into this narrative.

81,Clean_Clothes_Campaign,1496,"Fast fashion and the business model at its heart is the wider cause of both the environmental and social crisis in the industry. Ever cheaper and faster production is driving a regulatory climate that causes environmental and social damage to accelerate. The cost of environmental and social responsibility is held in production countries, but rarely paid for through retail value. Demand for clothing globally is continuing to increase quickly, particularly in growing consumer economies in Asia and Africa. By 2030 global apparel consumption is projected to rise by 63%, from today’s 62 million tons to 102 million tons, equivalent to more than 500 billion additional T-shirts. By 2050 this figure is likely to be even greater with total clothing sales predicted to reach 160 million tons – almost three times today’s amount. Worldwide, clothing utilisation rates have dropped significantly. The average number of times a garment is worn before it ceases to be used has decreased by 36% compared to 15 years ago. A survey of 20 countries showed that consumers now wear less than 50% of items in their wardrobe. The average American in 2019 bought 68 new pieces of clothing. In 1980 this figure was 12. Half of these items are now worn 3 times or less. This is unsustainable. According to the World Bank, the fashion industry currently accounts for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and 20% of industrial water pollution. Greenhouse gas emissions from textiles production in 2015 totalled 1"
82,Clean_Clothes_Campaign,1588,". The average American in 2019 bought 68 new pieces of clothing. In 1980 this figure was 12. Half of these items are now worn 3 times or less. This is unsustainable. According to the World Bank, the fashion industry currently accounts for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and 20% of industrial water pollution. Greenhouse gas emissions from textiles production in 2015 totalled 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2, which adds up to more than the total of all international flights and maritime shipping combined. If the industry continues on its current path, by 2050, it could use more than 26% of the carbon budget associated with a 2°C pathway. That is over a quarter of the world’s carbon budget taken up by the fashion industry alone. Something has to change. Climate change is already impacting communities in climate vulnerable countries, and workers in low income areas of these countries are the first to suffer the consequences. In 2019/20, production hubs in Indonesia experienced severe flooding, seeing urban slum housing areas where factory workers live washed away, while workers in production hubs in India experienced severe drought. In Karnataka state - a major garment producing hub which includes Bengaluru, 80% of districts were hit by drought and crop failure in 2019. A government think tank report said that 21 Indian cities, including Bengaluru, are expected to run out of groundwater by 2020, and 40% of India’s population will have no access to drinking water by 2030. This will impact India’s garment workers significantly. Climate change is also driving migration"

This will impact India’s garment workers significantly. Climate change is also driving migration. Migrant workers are vulnerable to exploitation as they lack social support networks and immediate family structures which often provide child care and distribute risk, compounding the problems caused by poverty pay and forced overtime. Poor regulation of the globalised market has stifled the development of protections for workers and the environment. Value in global supply chains is poorly distributed, contributing to a structural inability to address social and environmental concerns in the industry. While the majority of retail value remains in developed nations, the bulk of environmental and social ‘costs’ are held by developing nations. The relentless drive for cheaper production encourages countries with weak governance to compete for global business by degrading both labour rights and environmental standards. Cost cutting caused by competition in the global market leads to practices like illegal dumping of waste in rivers, or for workers, increasingly short term contracts to avoid paying seniority benefits and pushing forced overtime. Lack of transparency is bad for the environment and for workers’ rights. The complexity of garment production and the lack of data about where clothes are made means environmental and social damage is often hidden"
84,Clean_Clothes_Campaign,1565,". Lack of transparency is bad for the environment and for workers’ rights. The complexity of garment production and the lack of data about where clothes are made means environmental and social damage is often hidden. Consumers, workers, governments and even companies don’t know who makes our clothes and this allows for abuses of workers’ rights and natural resources to go unchecked. The fashion industry has marked its own homework for too long. Auditing, used systematically across the industry by companies to check if factories meet social and environmental standards, is severely lacking in validity. We encourage consumers to demand that both social and environmental justice is delivered. Brands must address the need for industry change, looking to find solutions for social and environmental crises concurrently. You can’t have one without the other. Addressing the crisis will mean looking at the model behind fast fashion, and enlisting the expertise of workers and unions in designing the future industry we need. The tools that we need are enforceable agreements, and mandatory human rights due diligence. Industry self-assessment is not enough and has been proven to fail time and time again. Governments must intervene to require mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence. They must ensure conditions are right for a strong civil society to develop –vital for improving both labour rights and environmental rights. Civil society – unions, NGOs and worker groups - must be invited to help design any new moves towards a circular economy"

86,Clean_Clothes_Campaign,94,Organisation: Clean Clothes Campaign URL: https://cleanclothes.org/ Page Title: fair contracts
87,Clean_Clothes_Campaign,1537,"Subcontracting work is the norm in the industry, often several layers deep. That means workers don't get a regular contract, but a series of short-term contracts or not even that. Forced overtime is common. Home workers and other vulnerable groups are even more at risk, as are workers in special ""Free Trade Zones"" or the informal sector. Garment production has always been a fast paced industry. Most factories contracted to produce garments and footwear for the companies selling these items are not able to meet production targets without sub-contracting more workers. This is often also due to high demand for certain products. The companies selling an item of clothing may suddenly double their order and expect it within the same delivery time. It is through the employment relationship that reciprocal rights and obligations are created between the employee and the employer. It continues to be the main vehicle through which workers gain access to the rights and benefits associated with employment in the areas of collective bargaining, labour law and social security. The reality is that many workers have continuous 3-month contracts, for years on end, with no guarantee of future extension. As brands and retailers develop buying policies that are based on lower prices, shorter lead times and terms of trade and credit more favorable to them, their relationships with suppliers are becoming increasingly unstable and temporary. This in turn is translating into an increase in job insecurity and worsening working conditions"
88,Clean_Clothes_Campaign,1598,". As brands and retailers develop buying policies that are based on lower prices, shorter lead times and terms of trade and credit more favorable to them, their relationships with suppliers are becoming increasingly unstable and temporary. This in turn is translating into an increase in job insecurity and worsening working conditions. Manufacturers continue to restructure and flexibilise employment relationships to meet the demands of the buyers, to maximize profits, and to keep the workforce under control. Employers and buyers are actively seeking ways to keep wages low and limit the employment relationship by creating precarious work arrangements. Recently Human Rights Watch conducted research into business practices of large brands, finding that factories hire workers through contractors to avoid making social security and pension contributions that would otherwise be legally required—a key cost-cutting strategy. They also found that in Cambodia, factories repeatedly use short-term contracts in excess of legally permissible limits, citing seasonal variations in brand orders. Precarious work arrangements are contractual arrangements that have the effect of depriving workers of the protection they are due under the employment relationship. The impact is especially hard on groups that are already vulnerable such as women, migrant workers and workers in free trade zones, and upon those working in the so-called 'informal economy'. Through our Urgent Appeal system, the CCC Network supports all workers who lost their job after a workplace conflict or violation of their rights"
89,Clean_Clothes_Campaign,1520,". The impact is especially hard on groups that are already vulnerable such as women, migrant workers and workers in free trade zones, and upon those working in the so-called 'informal economy'. Through our Urgent Appeal system, the CCC Network supports all workers who lost their job after a workplace conflict or violation of their rights. Informal workers are also the hardest hit in times of economic collapse. They are usually not supported by national security systems or eligible for relief. Our network supports these workers by running awareness campaigns and establishing relief funds these workers can access. Our partners also work directly with migrants, who are usually in the most precarious situations legally and economically in addition to their informal work status. An important aspect of the fight for better working conditions in the garment industry is the ability of workers to freely organise themselves. We make sure brands and companies respect the freedom of association of all workers, also when they are on a temporary contract. The garment and sportswear industries rely on production networks that utilize global outsourcing and subcontracting arrangements. Retailers and brands outsource the cut, make and trim (CMT) part of the garment manufacturing to trading companies or to employers. These in turn (sub)contract to other units or to home-based wage or own-account workers (also referred to as ‘bogus self-employment’ schemes).

These in turn (sub)contract to other units or to home-based wage or own-account workers (also referred to as ‘bogus self-employment’ schemes). Increasingly this includes the use of labour contractors. Governments are either 'modernizing' current labour laws, consciously refraining from implementing and enforcing them, or failing to protect private sector workers under the assumption that cheap labour is the only possible advantage in the current global economy, under pressure from international trade negotiations or because of corruption. Where legislation protecting the employment relationship is in place, implementation is often weak. In sum, flexibilisation and precariousness of production have gone hand in hand with flexibilisation and precariousness of employment relationships, leading to what has become known as precarious work arrangements."

92,Clean_Clothes_Campaign,1519,"The global garment and sportswear industry was founded on exploitation. These are the key issues and how we work to tackle them. Tens of millions of people work in the global garment and sportswear industry. Most of them work extremely long hours for very little pay. Sweatshop wages can be found from Asia to Eastern Europe to Latin America, with major brands admitting that literally zero of their workers earn a living wage. Fashion's search for the lowest costs comes at a high price: the health and sometimes even lives of workers. Thousands have died in factory fires and collapses. And other dangers lurk, like the use of hazardous chemicals or sandblasting. Then there's the noise, heat and bad ventilation. Subcontracting work is the norm in the industry, often several layers deep. That means workers don't get a regular contract, but a series of short-term contracts or not even that. Forced overtime is common. Home workers and other vulnerable groups are even more at risk, as are workers in special ""Free Trade Zones"" or the informal sector. The garment and footwear industry stretches around the world. Clothes and shoes sold in stores in the US, Canada, Europe, and other parts of the world typically travel across the globe.

Three out of five of the 100 billion garments made in 2018 will end up in landfill within a year. Toxic chemicals land in the environment and worker communities, and the production of cotton uses up vast amounts of water. Factory workers who manage to organise often face repression, or are fired. Fashion brands sometimes try to deny their responsability by hiding behind the fact they are outsourcing their production. However, international standards make clear that brands must make sure that all labour rights need to be respected and full remedy needs to be given when violations occur. Eighty percent of the estimated 40-60 million garment workers are female, and this is not a coincidence. In an industry notorious for less-than-decent working conditions, low wages, forced overtime and unsafe conditions, women are often deprived of maternity leave, child care and safe travel to work. These structural violations are made worse by gender based violence. Hundreds of thousands of migrants are employed throughout the garment and textile supply chains around the world.

Hundreds of thousands of migrants are employed throughout the garment and textile supply chains around the world. They are subjected to many of the same abuses that local workers encounter. However, these abuses are compounded by the specific contexts in which migrant workers work. Most production takes place in countries with the lowest wages, but also with the worst record on union freedom. Major garment producing countries, such as China, Bangladesh, Indonesia, The Philippines, Turkey, Vietnam belong to the worst countries for workers to organise in. Fashion brands have lots of nice policies listed on their websites. The problem is, most of these are non-binding and voluntary. Factory inspections are often announced before-hand, and are done by auditing firms who are paid by the brands, without any involvement of workers. The COVID-19 pandemic is touching lives all over the planet, but is hitting garment workers in particular. They risk their health working in crowded factories without sufficient protection and risk their livelihood if they are sent home without pay. Brands and retailers need to act to protect the workers who have enabled their profits in the past. Garment production is a major contributor to climate change and garment workers are being severely affected. Brands must urgently address the need for industry wide solutions to social and environmental crises concurrently. You can’t have one without the other."

The vast majority of garment workers – approximately 80% – are women. This is not by chance, but the result of discriminatory practices from start to finish. Women are desirable in the garment industry because employers take advantage of cultural stereotypes – to which women are often obliged to adhere – that portray women as passive and flexible. Productive, reproductive and domestic responsibilities such as cleaning, cooking and childcare constrain women’s ability to seek other types of employments. they just do not have the time or opportunity to improve their working conditions, or even speak out about the abuses they face on a daily basis, making them the ideal employees in management’s eyes.

104,Clean_Clothes_Campaign,1583,"We want everyone working in the garment industry to be paid a wage they can live on. The UN recognises a living wage as a human right, yet the current reality means millions of garment workers are systematically exploited as a source of cheap labour. Since the birth of the industry, garment workers all over the world have been forced to live in poverty, to the detriment of not only their own well-being but their communities and economies as well. The global garment industry has doubled over the past 15 years and is powered by an estimated 60 million-strong workforce. The deprivation that the vast majority of these workers and their families face on a daily basis stands in stark contrast with the huge profits reported annually by global fashion brands. Workers’ wages represent only a fraction of what consumers pay for the clothes because of deep-rooted structural power dynamics. A well-known example is the national kit of the England football team at the 2018 World Cup, embellished with a well-known sportswear brand logo and the most expensive England kit ever. They were sold to fans for as much as €180 – while the workers in Bangladesh who made them were earning less than €2 per day. UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights clearly state the role and responsibilities of businesses to respect the human right to fair wages. This responsibility “exists independently of States’ abilities and/or willingness to fulfil their own human rights obligations ... And it exists over and above compliance with national laws and regulations protecting human rights"

This responsibility “exists independently of States’ abilities and/or willingness to fulfil their own human rights obligations ... And it exists over and above compliance with national laws and regulations protecting human rights.” In other words, in cases where legal minimum wages fail to meet the minimum subsistence level (living wage) for workers in production countries – businesses have an obligation to remedy state failures. Yet our ongoing research shows that no major brand can prove all workers in their supply chain earn a living wage. The same holds for fast fashion, luxury brands and worker apparel alike. No garment or sportswear company recognises that brand business practices have a direct effect on workers’ wages, leaving millions of workers deprived of not only wages but sleep, access to health care, safe transport, the ability to live with loved ones, adequate food, education, even time poverty from needing to work extra hours. The financial difference fair business practice would have for brands is minuscule compared to the difference fair wages would have on workers' lives. The right to a living wage has been recognised by the Council of Europe and by the UN in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, among others, but it is not respected in global production supply chains, even where legally set minimum wages are in place"

The right to a living wage has been recognised by the Council of Europe and by the UN in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, among others, but it is not respected in global production supply chains, even where legally set minimum wages are in place. In order to reach a living wage, companies have to commit to fairer purchasing practices. If the solution rests on the factories and production country government policies then brands will always relocate to cheaper regions. Only when brands commit to paying more for orders can factories properly cover the costs of production, including labour. Our work revolves around asking companies to use living wage benchmarks when calculating order prices. By putting a figure on the living wage, the labour cost can be calculated and embedded into pricing breakdowns, and companies can use this to be sure that suppliers are receiving enough to pay a living wage. If enough companies do this, production-country governments are given a clear signal that putting up the minimum wage to a living-wage level will not risk loss of business. The Clean Clothes Campaign is part of the Asia Floor Wage Alliance, an alliance of Asian trade unions and labour groups, which has calculated a living wage formula for Asia. We feel this figure and methodology is the most robust, independent calculation for a living wage currently available, and is a vital tool in benchmarking what companies and governments should be aiming to achieve in terms of actual wage figures for workers"
107,Clean_Clothes_Campaign,1585,". We feel this figure and methodology is the most robust, independent calculation for a living wage currently available, and is a vital tool in benchmarking what companies and governments should be aiming to achieve in terms of actual wage figures for workers. It is calculated based on some key assumptions that we believe must always be central to a living wage: A living wage is always a family wage. In most production countries, the pension and insurance schemes are not sufficient and public care services are often absent. A genuine living wage must therefore take that into account and at least partially cover the basic needs of unpaid caregivers in the household. A living wage must allow for savings. Without this, workers remain in a vulnerable situation, are not able to make mid- and long-term plans in their lives and are at risk of ending up in debt when additional unforeseen financial expenditure is needed. A living wage has to put a floor, not a ceiling, on wage payment and secure a minimum income for all workers. Ideally, a living wage should have a regional approach so as not to increase wage competition between countries, instead increasing the base wage level for all workers. The commitment to a real living wage benchmark from companies also opens up space in wage negotiations between workers and factory owners. Currently, factory owners will say they have no choice but to keep wages low due to the low prices paid by buyers. In many cases this means that workers are under threat of losing their jobs or risk physical harm if they ask for higher wages"

Currently, factory owners will say they have no choice but to keep wages low due to the low prices paid by buyers. In many cases this means that workers are under threat of losing their jobs or risk physical harm if they ask for higher wages. But if unions or worker groups know that brands being produced in their factory have committed to a specified living wage figure, these negotiations are opened up, and a living wage becomes a possibility. Poverty pay is one of the most pressing issues for workers worldwide, and it is embedded systemically in the global garment and sportswear industries. Companies have relied for decades on this system of poverty pay and exploitation, justifying the outsourcing of cheaply paid assembly work with the need to remain competitive in the global market and to offer cheaper prices to consumers. Governments have kept minimum wages low under pressure from brands and retailers in a bid to create jobs and provide an economic boost to their state economies. As a result, minimum wage, where it exists as a legally binding standard, is not the same as a living wage. What the minimum wage amounts to differs per country, but in almost all production countries, it is far from sufficient to provide for workers’ and their families’ basic needs. Being paid poverty wages forces workers to work long hours to earn overtime or bonuses"

If they find themselves out of work or faced with unexpected expenses, they are thrown into deep poverty. There’s a host of related problems, such as poor housing, poor nourishment, inadequate access to health care, the risk of child labour, occupational accidents and violence against women."

Many garment producing countries and factories however curtail workers’ freedom of association through restrictive laws or outright union-busting actions, thereby limiting workers’ ability to take collective action and negotiate better working conditions. When apparel companies moved their production outside the countries where they were headquartered, they did so in search of the lowest wages, but also in pursuit of a more docile workforce. The garment industry moved into countries which restrict the right to organise and primarily hired workers who were considered to be less likely to speak up, such as (young) women, migrant workers, and workers on precarious contracts. Major garment producing countries, such as China, Bangladesh, Indonesia, The Philippines, Turkey, Vietnam belong to the worst countries for workers to organise in. They restrict this right out of fear of worker power or the wish to be as attractive to foreign investments as possible. The governments in these countries legally curtail the right for workers to form their own unions and crack down on strikes and other worker actions. In other countries freedom of association and collective bargaining might be protected as a constitutional right, but some governments put unreasonable constraints on this right or allow employers to mock this right.

In other countries freedom of association and collective bargaining might be protected as a constitutional right, but some governments put unreasonable constraints on this right or allow employers to mock this right. This turns the undermining of workers rights into a way of attracting foreign investment. In Bangladesh, for example, prospective unions face high thresholds for registration and arbitrary denials, as well as violent repression against strikes. Furthermore, factory owners in Bangladesh and many other countries practice union busting measures include firing union-leaders and striking workers, closing or relocating a factory to get rid of a union, and violence against union members. We see freedom of association as an enabling right that allows workers to stand up for themselves and fight for their own working conditions. We support workers in their struggle for their right to organise freely. Workers experiencing union-busting can contact us through our urgent appeal system. We work with them, contacting apparel companies buying from the union-busting factory, to push them to make sure that fired union leaders are reinstated, legal charges against workers are dropped, or factories pay out compensation to affected workers. During the COVID-19 pandemic we saw an alarming rise in the number of union busting cases.

Collective bargaining is the right of workers to join trade unions without fear of discrimination, to have their union recognised as the representative of its members, and to have this union negotiate the terms and conditions of their employment on their behalf. The right to organise with others to fight for better working conditions is a universal human right laid down in article 23 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and enshrined in two of the core conventions of the International Labour Organisation (no. 87 and 98).

The search of the global garment and sportswear industries for the lowest production costs comes at a high price: the health and safety of workers. After more than a century of work as CCC, developing national regulations and international conventions, workers continue to lose their health and lives while stitching our clothes. World-wide attention on worker safety in the garment industry has grown enormously since three devastating accidents that killed thousands of workers and shook the world: the factory fires of Ali Enterprises in Pakistan and Tazreen Fashions in Bangladesh, both 2012, and the Rana Plaza Collapse in 2013, Bangladesh. But workers are not only threatened by unsafe buildings. Dangerous practices, such as the unprotected use of chemical substances or sandblasting, continue to be common in the industry.

Also workers are subjected to verbal and psychological harassment and violence, especially the majority of women in the industry, who additionally potentially face gender based violence and sexual harassment. Immediately after the Rana Plaza collapse of 2013, in which 1,134 workers were killed, we were involved in the establishment of the legally binding Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh. This programme has been so successful in making factories safer that brands and unions decided to continue the work after its first five year mandate ran out. As witness signatories to the Accord we critically follow brands’ interaction with the Accord (see for example this report), campaign for brands to join the programme and campaign for its work to continue. Because of the Accord’s clear successes in making factories safer, unions and labour groups in other countries such as Pakistan are now looking into how the example can be adapted to national circumstances in other countries.

Therefore we want to make sure that workers receive full and fair compensation for their medical costs, loss of income, and pain and suffering if they do get injured on the job. Governments, brands, retailers and employers must all take their responsibility. In the cases of the mass disasters at Ali Enterprises, Tazreen and Rana Plaza we have fought long struggles to make sure that brands pay into funds to provide compensation to affected families. This is particularly important in absence of national social security systems that live up to international standards. In Bangladesh, we are therefore advocating for the establishment of a national employment injury insurance scheme. Many dangerous practices in garment factories are hidden deep in supply chains. Brands should be aware about these potential violations, actively address them and allow workers and activists to help in this process by making their supply chains more transparent.

The Rana Plaza collapse of 2013 functioned as an eye opener for the garment industry and accelerated processes that had started years before to address the problem of dangerous workplaces in Bangladesh. The establishment of the Accord, only weeks after the collapse, was a departure from the corporate-led voluntary, commercial system of auditing that had failed to prevent the mass disasters of the months, years and decades before. Truly sustainable safety in the workplace can only be reached if workers can address their own safety freely and refuse unsafe work, without fear of dismissal (see the report Our voices, our safety).

Over the years the Rana Plaza anniversary has become a moment of reflection to sum up the situation in the garment industry, especially in Bangladesh. Sandblasting, a method to make jeans look old or pre-worn using pressurised air and sand, is extremely dangerous for workers as it causes fatal silicosis and other respiratory diseases. As a network we have exposed the use of these methods in supply chains in a range of reports in 2010, 2012 and 2013. Our Killer Jeans campaign convinced over forty brands to ban sandblasting from their supply chains. Nevertheless up until today deeply hidden in supply chains sandblasting continues to occur, as well as alternatives with their own hazards, such as the use of chemicals for the same worn look. Research, media attention and training therefore continue to be needed and our network will continue to raise these issues."

The Circular Economy is a pivotal concept in the Cradle to Cradle Certified® framework, being regarded as much more than just a solution to the waste problems caused by linear business models, as seen in common definitions. Rooted in the principles of the Cradle to Cradle® design concept, this approach requires that every step of a product’s use cycle, from design to production, to post-user life, is part of a circular pathway.

139,Cradle_to_Cradle,1459,". Technical & Biological Pathways In our Cradle to Cradle Certified Product Standard, pathways can be technical or biological, with reference to the way a material is processed at the end of its use. We refer to a technical cycle when a product’s materials or parts are reprocessed for a new product use cycle via recycling, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing or reuse. Conversely, in the biological cycle, materials or parts are released, and ideally reprocessed via composting, biodegradation, nutrient extraction, or other biological metabolic pathways. Sustainability Performance Category Product Circularity is one of the five categories of the Cradle to Cradle Certified® Product Standard, built on the pillars of Circular Sourcing, Circular Design and Circular Systems.

Circular Economy How to design a circular product: R-strategies and Cradle to Cradle Certified® The so-called R-Strategies are widely known as design strategies for circular product design. So, what does it take to successfully apply these strategies to your product life cycle when you intend to work towards Cradle to Cradle Certified®? Circular Economy Engaging consumers in the Circular Shift Take a look back at this insightful panel exploring emerging consumer practices, challenges and opportunities with an inspirational panel of cross-sectoral leaders featuring Heather Barker from Reckitt, Alice Beyer Schuch from Bay City, Mads Kogsgaard Hansen from Bang & Olufsen, led by Joel Makower from GreenBiz Group. Three ways the circular economy can create value beyond circular material flows We know the linear economy is damaging our planet and impacting human health. Under the linear model, production and consumption have gone unchecked: the use of resources has tripled since 1970, putting increasing pressure on resource availability and producing more and more waste. What’s more, about 45% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from manufacturing and food production.

Based on the recently updated Cradle to Cradle Certified® Version 4.1 standard, this new certification offers measurable goals to guide all aspects of circular product development – from design and sourcing, to circular systems, packaging, and material health. Backed by rigorous third-party verification, C2C Certified® Circularity enables companies to confidently communicate their tangible steps toward circular economy leadership. As a supportive tool for compliance, the certification helps companies meet and go beyond evolving regulatory standards while fostering innovation in circular design. Elwyn Grainger-Jones, Executive Director at the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute, emphasized the urgency for circularity: ""Building on the success and network of Cradle to Cradle Certified®, this new certification will help companies create thousands more verified circular products that consumers can trust. As we continue to exceed critical planetary boundaries, the need for circularity in product design is more urgent than ever.” About C2C Certified® Circularity The requirements for C2C Certified® Circularity focus on Product Circularity, one of the five core categories of the Cradle to Cradle Certified® framework. These requirements are structured around three key areas: circular sourcing, circular design, and circular systems"
161,Cradle_to_Cradle,1339,".” About C2C Certified® Circularity The requirements for C2C Certified® Circularity focus on Product Circularity, one of the five core categories of the Cradle to Cradle Certified® framework. These requirements are structured around three key areas: circular sourcing, circular design, and circular systems. This comprehensive approach ensures that products are intentionally designed for their next use and actively cycled within their intended pathways, such as reuse and/or recycling paths– decoupling value creation from carbon emissions, turning waste into resources, and increasing long term resilience. “Expanding our portfolio with C2C Certified® Circularity is an excellent development in the 20-year legacy of the program, to further drive the shift toward safe, sustainable, and circular production practices,” said William McDonough, Co-founder of the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute. “This new certification reinforces the vital importance of circularity and regenerative practices to innovate into a world where products are designed for use and next use as perpetual, clean assets for future generations.” Alignment with EU and US Regulations One of the standout features of C2C Certified® Circularity is its ability to help companies stay ahead of existing and upcoming regulations and reporting requirements"
162,Cradle_to_Cradle,1267,".” Alignment with EU and US Regulations One of the standout features of C2C Certified® Circularity is its ability to help companies stay ahead of existing and upcoming regulations and reporting requirements. C2C Certified® Circularity goes beyond the baseline requirements of the EU’s Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) by tackling the problem of waste at the source, and generates a third-party verified Circularity Data Report that sets companies up for the Digital Product Passport (DPP); and, in the US, helps companies meet growing state-level requirements to reduce waste through Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policies, recycled content and recycling requirements. “As companies navigate the emerging landscape of EU regulations, this new certification helps set them up for both compliance and innovation,” said Christine Lemaitre, Chief Executive Officer of DGNB (German Sustainable Building Council) and Chair of the Board of Directors at the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute.

We are grateful for the support and the useful recommendations received throughout this process. C2C Certified® is the global standard for products that are healthy, circular and made with respect for people and planet. The standard is developed by the Institute and led by the multi-stakeholder Standards Steering Committee. With Version 4.0 of C2C Certified®, the institute aimed to integrate a due diligence approach according to the UN Guiding Principles and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance. The Institute recently launched a revised standard, Version 4.1, and embedded insights obtained from the assessment for closer alignment with the OECD Guidance. Completing the assessment has refined the sections on social and environmental policies and management systems, ensuring the approach supports impactful due diligence implementation. In an era of mandatory sustainability compliance, the Institute offers an improved approach by the aim to align with OECD standards. This supports companies to take responsibility while meeting global sustainability expectations.

169,Cradle_to_Cradle,1325,". This supports companies to take responsibility while meeting global sustainability expectations. General strengths C2C Certified® includes expectations related to all six steps of the OECD Garment Guidance and also contains comprehensive expectations on labour conditions. C2C Certified® addresses key product- and material related risks in the value chain by encouraging companies to design products of high-quality materials that prioritize the protection of human health and the environment with a strong focus on safe chemicals. On top of that, companies need to design products for cycling and to use recycled and/or renewable materials. The C2C Certified® standard is well-structured, clearly indicating which expectations apply at each level. The User Guidance details the expectations, outlines possible evidence allowing for consistent interpretation and assessment of the standard and supports enterprises with explanations of key concepts and examples. General opportunities for improvement The multi-category standard includes the recognition of other programs and certifications to overcome double auditing and to ensure responsible raw materials are prioritized. The alignment assessment concludes that some of the C2C Certified® requirements may promote over-reliance by companies on third-party verification"
170,Cradle_to_Cradle,1576,". General opportunities for improvement The multi-category standard includes the recognition of other programs and certifications to overcome double auditing and to ensure responsible raw materials are prioritized. The alignment assessment concludes that some of the C2C Certified® requirements may promote over-reliance by companies on third-party verification. While C2C Certified® encourages companies to make progress over time through the different certification levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum), including through mandating that products cannot remain Bronze level certified for more than six years, the varying supply chain scope of the criteria across the different certification levels is not without challenges. The standard incentivizes companies to focus their due diligence on certain supply tiers, types of suppliers, and risks, which is not fully consistent with key overarching principles of the OECD due diligence. The purpose of the C2C Certified® approach is to ensure that companies do not overlook suppliers associated with the most significant risks and impacts along their supply chain, leaving these unidentified and unaddressed. Additionally, the framing of several criteria that companies must fulfil before re-certification could unintentionally encourage them to delay actions until immediately prior to re-certification. Finally, the last conclusion is that the standard and User Guidance use some inconsistent terminology and needs to add some definitions. This is an issue that has been addressed in the revised standard (Version 4.1)"
171,Cradle_to_Cradle,1544,". Finally, the last conclusion is that the standard and User Guidance use some inconsistent terminology and needs to add some definitions. This is an issue that has been addressed in the revised standard (Version 4.1). What is improved in Cradle to Cradle Certified® Version 4.1? The majority of the Environmental Policy and Management requirements have been updated with the latest standard revision. The scope of the Bronze level on environmental policy, risk assessment, and strategy, as well as the Silver and Gold levels on management system requirements have been strengthened. Under the Version 4.1 standard, these requirements now apply to the applicant company rather than focusing primarily on final manufacturing stage facilities and the certified product. Under the updated V4.1 standard, environmental topics are now included in the Bronze level risk assessment. These topics encompass greenhouse gas emissions and their contribution to climate change, environmental pollution (air, fresh and marine water, soil), resource use and circularity, biodiversity, and ecosystems. For large companies (≥ 250,000 employees), these same issues must always be addressed in the company’s environmental policy. For other companies, these issues must be addressed in the policy if they are identified as high-risk per the risk assessment. The scope of the Silver level monitor and verify performance requirements, as well as the Silver and Gold level grievance mechanism, transparency, and stakeholder engagement requirements, has been expanded"
172,Cradle_to_Cradle,1393,". For other companies, these issues must be addressed in the policy if they are identified as high-risk per the risk assessment. The scope of the Silver level monitor and verify performance requirements, as well as the Silver and Gold level grievance mechanism, transparency, and stakeholder engagement requirements, has been expanded. These requirements now encompass both environmental and human rights aspects. Previously under Version 4.0, these requirements were only found in the Social Fairness category and focused solely on human rights. With these updates, the Environmental Policy & Management requirements will be aligned with the human rights due diligence requirements already present in the Version 4.0 Social Fairness category. This alignment ensures that the standard includes a comprehensive set of human rights and environmental due diligence requirements, increasingly consistent with leading regulations and international guidelines including the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSRD) and the OECD’s Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct. The institute expresses its gratitude to the OECD and will continue to work towards developing the most optimal standards for companies to create a positive impact through the design and production of C2C Certified® products.

Our community includes companies operating in the Apparel, Textiles and Footwear sectors, mostly consisting of fashion brands and retailers, but also suppliers and manufacturing facilities where garments, workwear, footwear, accessories, textiles or leather goods for different applications are designed and produced. While consumers, investors and policymakers have an important role to play in the transition to a circular economy, companies are expected to take center-stage, and leverage available powerful frameworks to elevate the circular economy. Companies in the Cradle to Cradle Certified Products Program are the frontrunners of the sector, driving sustainable innovation by designing and making safe, circular and responsibly made products. Circular Pathways for Apparel and Textiles The apparel, textile and footwear industries produce high quantities of ‘textile waste’ which include textile items at the end of life, discarded items (because out of fashion/or change in weight), fabric and leather leftovers (overstock), or fabric scraps from facilities. Sometimes they also include textile and leather products that have been produced but not sold. These industries have the opportunity - and the ability - to activate the creative and commercial mindset needed to create future business models that take advantage of such waste, full of sources.

181,Cradle_to_Cradle,1440,".” Frederikke Antonie Schmidt | Founder & Creative Director Roccamore Fast-Changing Regulatory Landscapes Our program helps companies to stay ahead of the game, comply with upcoming legislations, and validate green claims. For example, the EU Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles is a comprehensive legislative initiative whose proposals range from Eco Design to Green claims requirements, to Digital Product Passports, to the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). In the near future all regulated products will have Digital Product Passports, making it easier to repair or recycle products and facilitate tracking substances of concern along the supply chain. The proposal also contains measures to end the destruction of unsold consumer goods, as well as expand green public procurement and provide incentives for sustainable products. EPR, for instance, holds producers accountable for the waste that their products create. The requirements entail separate collection of waste and its subsequent management in line with the waste hierarchy. EPR also incentivizes product design that promotes circularity throughout the material life cycle and takes account of the end of products’ life. Several EU Member States, including the Netherlands and France, already introduced EPR requirements for textile companies, given the obligation under EU waste legislation to establish separate collection of textile waste by 1 January 2025"

Together, they explored why the conversation feels tougher, how professionals can reframe their approach, and how to continue making an impact no matter what the external climate may be. If you’re ready to make an impact, no matter how the vibes feel, here’s what you can do: Why sustainability feels harder right now The business landscape is shifting, and sustainability in all shapes and forms is now facing more scrutiny, especially in the US market. Companies are crunching numbers, investors are looking for quick returns, and some people are wondering if prioritizing sustainability still makes sense. “There’s a sense that people want to do the right thing, but they’re also worried about how it affects their bottom line,” Holly pointed out. Ren added “it’s not just about money, it’s about burnout. People are wondering if what they’re doing even makes a difference.” Sound familiar? The good news: There’s a way forward. Focus on client goals and reframe the conversation If sustainability talk is getting pushback our advice is to reframe the conversation. We heard someone in the industry recently say “we’re changing the words, not the strategy.” Instead of leading with sustainability goals, try focusing on things that resonate with your audience. This starts with understanding your client and their goals for the project"
189,Cradle_to_Cradle,1471,". We heard someone in the industry recently say “we’re changing the words, not the strategy.” Instead of leading with sustainability goals, try focusing on things that resonate with your audience. This starts with understanding your client and their goals for the project. Just like designers listen to client goals and turn it into compelling concepts and space planning, ask your client questions to understand what their needs are, what problems or challenges this project is trying to solve, what their priorities are as a company. From there, you can frame sustainability in the terms that resonate with them. Here are some examples of how this can look when you encounter real life roadblocks (that we have all faced at some time!): Focus on benefits, not buzzwords: For the C-suite or leadership, sustainability isn’t about being ‘green’–it’s about future-proofing their business and avoiding regulatory headaches. Cradle to Cradle Certified®, a multi-attribute and 3rd party verified program is a measurable pathway of innovation and sustainability optimization, giving you many entry points of specific benefits that you can frame conversations with leadership teams around. Are they concerned about rising energy costs? Decarbonization is a great way to reduce those costs long-term. Are they looking at de-risking their supply chain? Looking at material health and social fairness are great places to start in terms of evaluating risk throughout a supply chain"
190,Cradle_to_Cradle,1571,". Are they concerned about rising energy costs? Decarbonization is a great way to reduce those costs long-term. Are they looking at de-risking their supply chain? Looking at material health and social fairness are great places to start in terms of evaluating risk throughout a supply chain. Use different words: For example instead of saying “material transparency” or “healthy materials” you can advocate for creating spaces that feel good and create great customer experiences by using materials that don’t off gas and improve indoor air quality. Maybe even cite some studies showing people are more productive and happier in these spaces. When they say it’s too expensive: Is it though? Talk about the long term costs, maintenance costs, and durability of materials if you’re a designer. If you’re in a corporate role, talk about long term financial gains by reducing risk in your supply chain and staying ahead of upcoming regulations. Do it anyway, you just don’t have to say anything about it: Sometimes the most effective thing to do in times like this is just doing whatever you can and not mentioning it! For example, Ren mentioned adding a Red List Free paint into her firms base spec without telling anyone. Holly mentioned times when she presented options to leadership and every option met baseline sustainability criteria so she didn’t even have to make the argument to choose a sustainable option. If you are in a place where you can’t even bring it up, there might be ways for you to implement small impacts without having to ask permission or focus on it"

Holly mentioned times when she presented options to leadership and every option met baseline sustainability criteria so she didn’t even have to make the argument to choose a sustainable option. If you are in a place where you can’t even bring it up, there might be ways for you to implement small impacts without having to ask permission or focus on it. What you can do for yourself right now In uncertain and chaotic times (like right now!), humans naturally crave safety and certainty, but when those feel out of reach, the best thing we can do is focus on ourselves. That doesn’t mean forced optimism–it means building resilience, creativity, calm, and hope by developing self-awareness. Understanding our habits, beliefs, and subconscious programming helps us direct our energy and attention in ways that serve us. By becoming more aware of our inner critic and shifting our focus, we can navigate uncertainty with greater confidence and clarity. Here are some great ways to do that, at all levels in your career: For yourself: Finding a support system and holding onto hope comes from being together and focusing on things we can directly effect. Cultivate resilience by paying attention to your own attention–where are you focused? Instead of doomscrolling, find small things in a day that you can do that help regain your focus–get your body moving, text or call a friend, do a crossword puzzle or read a book. All of these strategies have been proven to help you feel better, more focused, and more resilient"

All of these strategies have been proven to help you feel better, more focused, and more resilient. As a team leader: As a team leader, you have a huge influence on how your people show up. Gallup research shows that up to 70% of an employee’s engagement comes from their direct manager–not the company or its mission, but you. In a world struggling with loneliness, anxiety, and burnout, your leadership can give your team hope and direction. The key is knowing yourself, your strengths, your weaknesses, so you can lead with awareness and impact. Gallup’s 2025 Global Leadership Report, based on decades of research across 52 countries, revealed a powerful insight: the most impactful leaders provide hope, trust, compassion, and stability –with hope being the most frequently mentioned trait. This shows that as a leader, you have the power to be a beacon of hope for your team. It’s a big responsibility but understanding what your people truly need is the first step to build the trust that leads to hope. And remember, as a leader, you’re also a follower–these same qualities matter for you too. Leadership isn’t just about managing; it’s about mentoring and making a real difference"

Don’t believe me, check out this great blog they wrote about how we can stop wasting our time and make real progress. Join groups doing this work in your community: inspiration, passion, and energy to keep going comes from being around others who are also doing the work! Keep asking! Be vocal with your reps and manufacturers about what your sustainability goals are and they will listen! The average designer has 26x the spending power of an average consumer, so manufacturers are definitely listening when you tell them what you want because they want your business. Manufacturers: Track sustainability requests: this helps build the business case for pursuing sustainability goals and certifications. Check out what your competitors are doing: understanding the competitive landscape can help build the case internally that sustainability isn’t just a “nice to have” but a “need to have.” Change procurement policies or supplier contracts (if you can): start working with suppliers who take sustainability as seriously as you do, and expand your impact beyond your own doors.

Sum it up for me: Despite the challenges, one thing hasn’t changed: People want healthier, more sustainable products. The key is meeting them where they are, speaking their language, and making sustainability feel like a smart, strategic choice—not an extra burden. The vibes might feel off, but the work isn’t stopping. If we adjust our messaging and stay committed, we can make real impacts. Keep it up!

What we found there was one of the most exploitative enterprises in the world. Each year, the country’s billion dollar cotton industry was responsible for massive environmental destruction - including the draining of the Aral Sea - and was being propped up by state-controlled forced, child labour. EJF investigators documented children as young as seven handpicking the cotton for days on end; they were doing this not to help their parents’ meagre income on family farms, but because the brutal and corrupt government shut schools across the country and compelled children to labour in the fields. Award-winning investigations in our 2006 report, White Gold: the True Cost of Cotton, and award-winning film of the same name, highlighted the Uzbek government's routine use of forced labour. EJF’s follow-up investigative report, Still in the Fields, revealed that, despite Uzbekistan signing two International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions on child labour, the government was still using child labour in cotton fields. In 2022, the Uzbek Forum for Human Rights released its monitoring report finding no state-imposed forced labour in the 2021 cotton harvest.

But cotton is also one of the ‘dirtiest’ and ‘thirstiest’ crops on the planet, consuming high levels of pesticides and water. Since 2005, EJF has worked to raise awareness of the environmental and human rights abuses in the global cotton industry. EJF has uncovered the true costs of our global cotton addiction and showcased just how transparency in the supply chain could be achieved. EJF is campaigning for the fashion industry to support the rapid transition to organic cotton as a sustainable and ethical material that supports rural livelihoods and secures a healthy environment."

The European Commission adopted the circular economy action plan (CEAP) in March 2020. It is one of the main building blocks of the European Green Deal, Europe’s agenda for sustainable growth. The EU’s transition to a circular economy will reduce pressure on natural resources and will create sustainable growth and jobs. It is also a prerequisite to achieve the EU’s 2050 climate neutrality target and to halt biodiversity loss. The action plan includes initiatives addressing the entire life cycle of products. It targets how products are designed, promotes circular economy processes, encourages sustainable consumption, and aims to ensure that waste is prevented and the resources used are kept in the EU economy for as long as possible."

A third package was presented in March 2023, including a proposal for regulating green claims by companies and guaranteeing a right to repair products. In July 2023, the Commission proposed a revision of the Waste Framework Directive to promote the sustainable management of textile and food waste. In October 2022, Parliament approved a revision of rules on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to reduce the amount of dangerous chemicals in waste and production processes. The new rules will introduce stricter limits, ban certain chemicals and keep pollutants away from recycling. In April 2024, Parliament approved establishing of EU-wide certification scheme for carbon removals. It will ensure carbon removal activities are measured in an accurate way, while carbon is stored for as long as possible.

The Critical Raw Materials Act, pursuing these aims, was adopted in December 2023. To achieve an EU market of sustainable, climate-neutral and resource-efficient products, the Commission proposed extending the Ecodesign Directive to non-energy-related products and creating Digital Product Passports, with the aim of sharing all relevant information along the product lifecycle. Parliament and the Council reached a deal on the new rules, which Parliament approved in April 2024. MEPs also backed initiatives to fight planned obsolescence, improve the durability and reparability of products and to strengthen consumer rights with the right to repair. Parliament adopted the directive in April 2024. New rules should ensure that it is easier and cheaper to repair products instead of purchasing new ones.

Making crucial sectors circular Circularity and sustainability must be incorporated in all stages of a value chain to achieve a fully circular economy: from design to production and all the way to the consumer. The Commission action plan sets down seven key areas essential to achieving a circular economy: plastics; textiles; e-waste; food, water and nutrients; packaging; batteries and vehicles; buildings and construction. Plastics MEPs back the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy, which would phase out the use of microplastics. Textiles Textiles use a lot of raw materials and water, with less than 1% recycled. The EU strategy for sustainable and circular textiles presented by the Commission in March 2022 aims to ensure that by 2030 textile products placed on the EU market are long-lived and recyclable, made as much as possible of recycled fibres and free of hazardous substances.

248,EU_Parliament,1458,"Carriages preview | Legislative Train Schedule The Commission tabled a proposal for a revision of the waste framework directive to reduce waste, including food waste, and the environmental impact of waste management on 5 July 2023. Concerning food waste, the proposed directive introduces binding food waste reduction targets to be achieved at national level. By the end of 2030, EU countries would have to reduce food waste by 10% in processing and manufacturing, and by 30% (per capita), jointly at retail and consumption levels (restaurants, food services and households), compared to the amounts generated in 2020. Within two years of the entry into force of the proposed directive, EU countries would need to review and adapt their food waste prevention programmes required by the Waste framework directive (WFD) as revised in 2018, in order to attain those targets. Regarding textiles, the amending directive proposes to introduce mandatory and harmonised extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes for textiles, textile-related and footwear products across all EU countries, with eco-modulation of fees. It also sets requirements to ensure the management of textile waste in line with the waste hierarchy, including provisions to stop the practice of exports of waste disguised as being done for reuse.

In Parliament, the proposal was referred to the committee on Environment, Public health and Food safety (ENVI), with Anna Zalewska (ECR, Poland) as rapporteur. The Committee adopted its position on 14 February 2024 by 72 votes to none, with 3 abstentions.

These targets should be achieved at national level by 30 December 2030. Instead of a review in 2027 to set a target to half food waste by 2030, the text provides for the Commission to assess the situation and present appropriate legislative proposals to introduce higher targets for 2035 (at least 30% and 50% respectively).

The reduction of food waste and food loss are two of the EU’s main objectives in order to achieve a circular economy by 2050. Causes of food waste Insufficient shopping and meal planning, “ugly” fruits and vegetables, impulsive buying as a result of retail promotions, inappropriate packaging size are just some of the reasons for food waste by households, which accounts for the majority of food waste. Standardised portions and overestimating the number of guests are among the reasons for food waste in restaurants and food services. According to a study carried out by the European Commission, date labelling on food, such as “use by” and “best before”, is also one of the reason for food waste. A better understanding of the labels could potentially help reduce food waste by up to 10%. Why is reducing food waste important? Reducing food waste is necessary to fight climate change.

Reducing food waste is necessary to fight climate change. It accounts for approximately 16% of all the greenhouse gases from the EU food system. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the production and transportation of food that is later wasted accounts for 8% of global greenhouse emissions. By reducing food waste, households and companies could save money. EU legislation for food waste reduction The goals of the Farm to Fork Strategy include making date labelling clearer and stopping their wrong use to help reduce food waste. Under this strategy, the Commission will also investigate the loss of food throughout the entire food-supply chain. Food donation is another way to reduce unnecessary food waste. The EU food donation guidelines were adopted in 2017 with the aim of facilitating the recovery and redistribution of safe, edible food to those in need. Additionally, a common EU methodology was adopted in 2019 in order to measure food waste at each stage of the food-supply chain. Common methodology eases the monitoring and reporting of food waste across the EU.

The new Circular Economy Action Plan identified textiles as a key product value chain that requires urgent EU action due to its high use of resources and high impact on the environment. The strategy explains how new legislation should tie together to make textiles more sustainable. The agreement obliges manufacturers to provide information concerning spare parts in their website, make them available to all parties in the repair sector at a reasonable price and forbid practices that prevent the use of second-hand or 3D printed spare parts by independent repairers. The provisional agreement keeps the scope of the directive to those products for which the EU legislation lays down reparability requirements (i.e. washing machines, dishwashers, refrigerators, or vacuum cleaners)."

The proposal wants to ensure that more products are repaired within the legal guarantee, and that consumers have easier and cheaper options to have technically repairable products repaired when the legal guarantee has expired. The new proposal is meant to strengthen the demand side by promoting repair in the after-sales phase. Parliament called on the Commission to grant consumers a “right to repair” by making repairs more appealing, systematic, and cost-efficient, whether by extending guarantees, providing guarantees for replaced parts, or better access to information on repair and maintenance."

To tackle the impact on the environment, the EU wants to reduce textile waste and increase the life cycle and recycling of textiles. This is part of the plan to achieve a circular economy by 2050. Overconsumption of natural resources It takes a lot of water to produce textile, plus land to grow cotton and other fibres. To make a single cotton t-shirt, 2,700 litres of fresh water are required according to estimates, enough to meet one person’s drinking needs for 2.5 years. The textile sector was the third largest source of water degradation and land use in 2020. In that year, it took on average nine cubic metres of water, 400 square metres of land and 391 kilogrammes (kg) of raw materials to provide clothes and shoes for each EU citizen.

A single laundry load of polyester clothes can discharge 700,000 microplastic fibres that can end up in the food chain. The majority of microplastics from textiles are released during the first few washes. Fast fashion is based on mass production, low prices and high sales volumes that promotes many first washes. Washing synthetic products leads to the accumulation of more than half a million tonnes of microplastics on the bottom of the oceans every year. In addition to this global problem, the pollution generated by garment production has a devastating impact on the health of local people, animals and ecosystems where the factories are located. Greenhouse gas emissions According to the European Environment Agency, textile purchases in the EU in 2020 generated about 270 kg of CO2 emissions per person. That means textile products consumed in the EU generated greenhouse gas emissions of 121 million tonnes.

While the Commission proposed that the extended producer responsibility schemes should be introduced 30 months after the directive enters into force, MEPs pushed for 18 months. In addition, EU countries would be obliged to collect textiles separately by 1 January 2025 for re-use, preparing for re-use and recycling. “We request a textile waste reduction target, with an oversight of exported used textiles,” said Anna Zalewska (ECR, Poland), the MEP responsible for steering the rules through Parliament. She also called for better infrastructure for separate collection of textiles and more efficient sorting of municipal waste, so that items which can be recycled are extracted before being sent to the incinerator or landfill. Next steps The negotiations with the Council will be done by the next Parliament, which will be elected during the European elections on 6-9 June 2024."

Published: 06-04-2018 Last updated: 21-03-2024 - 09:58 7 min read Each European generated on average five tonnes of waste in 2022, which adds up to more than 2.2 billion tonnes in total. About 38.4% of all waste was generated in construction (38.4%), followed by mining and quarrying (22.7%), waste and water services (10.5%), manufacturing (10.4%) and households (8.9%). Other economic activities, mainly services (5.2%) and energy (3.0%), generated the remaining part (9.2%). Major mineral waste accounts for a large share of total waste (64%). This comes from mining, quarrying, construction and demolition. Apart from major mineral waste, the biggest sources of waste in 2022 were waste and water services (216 million tonnes), households (193 million tonnes) and manufacturing activities (166 million tonnes).

297,EU_Parliament,1557,". Waste treatment in the EU Almost two billion tonnes of waste were treated in the EU in 2022. This number is not the same as for generated waste, because it includes waste imported into the EU and excludes waste exported from the EU. Waste can be used in different ways in what is known as waste recovery. Waste can be recycled, used for backfilling (which means replacing soil for slope reclamation or safety or engineering purposes in landscaping) or it can be incinerated and the energy produced out of this process used. In less than two decades, from 2004 to 2022, the amount of recovered waste increased by 40.6%, from 870 to 1,223 million tonnes. Recovered waste accounted for more than half of the total waste (61.4%) in 2022. The remaining waste was either landfilled (30.2%), incinerated without energy recovery (0.4%) or disposed in some other way (8.0%). Municipal waste Municipal waste consists of waste generated by households, shops, offices and public institutions. It accounts for only about 10% of the total waste and is managed by municipal authorities. In 2022, the volume of generated municipal waste varied significantly between EU countries, from 301 kilos per capita in Romania to 803 kilos per capita in Austria. Municipal waste management practices across the EU Waste management practices also vary between EU countries. The EU wants to promote the prevention of waste and the re-use of products as much as possible. If this is not possible, it prefers recycling (including composting), followed by using waste to generate energy"
298,EU_Parliament,1555,". Municipal waste management practices across the EU Waste management practices also vary between EU countries. The EU wants to promote the prevention of waste and the re-use of products as much as possible. If this is not possible, it prefers recycling (including composting), followed by using waste to generate energy. The most harmful option for the environment and people's health is simply disposing of waste, for example in a landfill, although it's one of the cheapest possibilities. Even though we generate more waste, the way we manage it has improved with more recycling and less landfilling. 60% of everyday waste collected and treated by municipalities must be reused or recycled by 2030 according to EU targets. The share of recycled municipal waste rose from 19% in 1995 to 48% in 2022, while in the same period the share of landfilled waste dropped from 61% to 23%. In line with the EU Landfill Directive, EU countries must reduce the amount of municipal waste sent to landfill to 10% or less of the total municipal waste generated by 2035.

In 2022, EU exports of waste to non-EU countries reached 32.1 million tonnes. This is a slight decrease of 3% compared to 2021.

In 2022, 39% of EU waste went to Türkiye (12.4 million tonnes), followed by India (3.5 million tonnes), the UK (2.0 million tonnes), Switzerland (1.6 million tonnes) and Norway (1.6 million tonnes). The EU wants to counter illegal exports and ensure waste is managed in an environmentally sound manner in the destination countries. In February 2024, Parliament approved stricter rules for waste shipments to non-EU countries. The rules prohibit plastic waste exports to non-OECD countries and introduce stricter conditions for exports to OECD countries. Shipping waste to another EU country is possible only in exceptional circumstances. The EU’s work to achieve a circular economy The European Union wants to build a circular and climate-neutral economy by 2050. To achieve that, the EU has introduced in recent years many new measures to reduce waste and make products more sustainable. New or updated legislation covers ecodesign, packaging, greenwashing, the right to repair, waste management and other key areas."

With increasing interest and engagement in landscape initiatives, it is critical that all stakeholders have a simple and consistent understanding of the core elements of a mature landscape initiative. Twenty leading landscape practitioner organisations have come together to align on four core criteria and accompanying sub-criteria, and to define six applications for the criteria. The criteria present both a roadmap for new and existing landscape initiatives to improve their effectiveness and a means by which to assess the maturity of these initiatives for different purposes or use cases.

351,Gold_Standard,1524,"announcement UPDATED Jun 4, 2025 Integrity Council approves Adipic Acid and further clean cookstove methodology versions 3 June 2025 – Gold Standard is pleased to share that the Integrity Council (ICVCM) has approved versions 2, 3, and 3.1 of our clean cooking and heating methodology (TPDDTEC) as meeting its Core Carbon Principles (CCPs) —provided certain conditions are met. ICVCM’s latest recognition highlights the strong track record and credibility of the methodologies used by hundreds of clean cooking projects under Gold Standard. It also opens the door for more projects to earn the CCP label for future carbon credit issuances under their existing methodology. It follows ICVCM’s earlier approval in February 2025 of version 4 of the TPDDTEC methodology, along with our approaches for Metered & Measured Cooking Devices and Animal Manure Management and Biogas Use for Thermal Energy—again, subject to specific conditions. In April, Gold Standard published clear requirement for projects aiming to label their GS-VERs as CCP-compliant and we are already working with project developers to help them apply these requirements and move forward with clean cooking initiatives. Following the ICVCM decision, we will publish the updated version of requirements with further details for V2, 3, and 3.1 in the coming weeks.

These requirements will be supported with further tools and guidance. A timeline is provided below. Biomass Accounting: fNRB Updates for Clean Cooking Projects FNRB is a key parameter in several impact quantification methodologies, including those for clean cooking. It represents the share of biomass, such as wood or charcoal, harvested from non-renewable sources. Over recent years, fNRB values have been the subject of debate. Recently, the UNFCCC and ICVCM have made significant progress on values and calculation methods. The CDM methodology panel has recommended new default values and approaches—with the Executive Board providing additional guidance for improvements. Meanwhile, the ICVCM has approved cookstove and biodigester methodologies with specific conditions to ensure more conservative fNRB values. In order to ensure Gold Standard projects remain at the forefront of integrity and aligned with the latest norms and science, from 30 June 2025 the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Tool 30 will no longer be eligible for new projects.

While it’s tempting to look for quick fixes this opens companies up to criticism and can be more expensive in the long run. The age of urgency requires credible, transparent action from corporate actors. Though there are many barriers to climate action, Gold Standard can help guide your planning and actions, regardless of where you are on your journey. Authors Gold Standard team, Secretariat Download the Top 9 Summary ACTION 1 DON’T BE AFRAID TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP Visit the GHG Protocol website to learn about GHG inventories and understand what carbon accounting is. Read SBTI’s Net Zero Standard and check out Gold Standards blog series on key topics for demystifying net zero. Make early public statements about your commitment to act, rather than setting big, binary goals. ACTION 2 SET UP YOUR GOVERNANCE Establish good practices in climate governance at both board and management levels. Place your climate team at the heart of your business so they can influence financial decisions. Include stakeholders and experts, for example by setting up an advisory group that represents your work and what it needs to achieve. ACTION 3 TRANSPARENTLY DISCLOSE EMISSIONS Use freely available tools and build a comprehensive GHG inventory covering Scopes 1,2 and 3.

381,Gold_Standard,1592,"opinion UPDATED Jun 21, 2024 The business case for Climate Adaptation: why it’s a profitable investment “Adaptation should not be seen as a cost, but as an investment… Adaptation is good business.” Prof. Dr. Patrick Verkooiljen, CEO, Global Center on Adaptation. Authors Gold Standard Recent events have starkly highlighted the urgent need for climate adaptation. The 2023 heatwaves in the Pacific Northwest and Canada, the fires in Rhodes, the devastating floods in Germany and Belgium, and Madagascar's worst drought in decades all underscore the increasing risks of climate extremes. Coupled with the latest IPCC report warning of more frequent and severe climate events, these incidents emphasise the pressing need for investment in climate adaptation strategies. The time to act is now, to both safeguard our future and seize the opportunities this challenge presents. Climate adaptation is a strategic move not a charitable act. It ensures resilience, risk management, and supply chain support in the face of the climate crisis. Governments, corporations, and impact investors fail to incorporate climate adaptation measures into their strategies are not only missing out on returns, but also endangering their value chains. The economic advantages of climate adaptation include consistent or increased agricultural production, higher household incomes, improved environmental services, long term assets, and reduced vulnerability to extreme weather events. The World Resources Institute finds that every dollar invested in adaptation yields net economic benefits ranging from $2 to $10"
382,Gold_Standard,1543,". The economic advantages of climate adaptation include consistent or increased agricultural production, higher household incomes, improved environmental services, long term assets, and reduced vulnerability to extreme weather events. The World Resources Institute finds that every dollar invested in adaptation yields net economic benefits ranging from $2 to $10. Climate adaptation vs. mitigation – a false choice Some argue that by advocating for adaptation we are losing focus on what matters most – mitigation. The IC-VCM (Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market) resisted a call from the alliance of small island developing states (Aosis) recommending a 5% levy on carbon credit revenues for the Adaptation Fund. It was argued the extra costs it would impose credits could lead to less projects and more emissions. Investing in climate adaptation can reduce investment risks by avoiding damages and losses. By incorporating adaptation measures into their projects and portfolios, businesses can ensure the longevity of their investments. Even if we limit global heating to 1.5 degrees the world will still change, necessitating adaptation. Climate adaptation must occur alongside mitigation efforts. The challenge rests on the misconception that there is a discrepancy between mitigation and adaptation. It is vital that as the world travels towards net zero adaptation and mitigation activities are integrated. As the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) put it: “The solution lies in climate-resilient development"

It is vital that as the world travels towards net zero adaptation and mitigation activities are integrated. As the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) put it: “The solution lies in climate-resilient development. It integrates adaptation and mitigation to advance sustainable development for all…” The Business Case for Climate Adaptation Investment Climate adaptation finance is not seen as profitable enough to attract private funding because it is a preventative measure. In accounting it is hard to value what has been “avoided”. As a result, currently only 1.6% of adaptation funds come from the private sector. However the World Bank states that investing in climate adaptation leads to returns with an average benefit cost ratio of 4:1. The market for adaptation could be worth $2 trillion per year by 2026, indicating a missed opportunity for profit. The business case of adaptation finance is demonstrated by Commercial International Bank’s Green Bonds. The transactions were commercially viable loans with proven business cases for the bank and clients that supported desalination and water treatment. Collaboration for a Climate Resilient Future Global climate adaptation finance reached $46 billion in 2019/2020 according to a report by the Climate Policy Initiative"
384,Gold_Standard,1470,". The transactions were commercially viable loans with proven business cases for the bank and clients that supported desalination and water treatment. Collaboration for a Climate Resilient Future Global climate adaptation finance reached $46 billion in 2019/2020 according to a report by the Climate Policy Initiative. Estimated costs for 2020-2030 are between $155 billion and $330 billion annually in developing economies according to UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme). And just 50 developing countries identified more than $50 billion per year in adaptation needs in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) according to their 2018 Adaptation Gap Report. Governments alone do not have the funds to drive the investments needed. The private sector must also engage in climate change adaptation activities—including as designers, implementers, financers, or evaluators - they need to establish and communicate the business case for investing in adaptation. A good starting point will be to develop partnerships with others across the investment value chain to ensure that the right capital and support is available. Partnering with accelerators, and both early and late-stage investors is key to supporting innovations, to help solutions become investment-ready, and to grow. It is also vital to work with regulators, standard setters, private businesses and with other governments to unlock private capital and ensure that priority investments happen"

It is also vital to work with regulators, standard setters, private businesses and with other governments to unlock private capital and ensure that priority investments happen. To encourage private sector engagement in climate change adaptation activities, it is crucial to clearly communicate the business case for investing in climate adaptation. Addressing the Climate Adaptation Data Gap To encourage global-scale investments we need a clear metric to measure progress in long-term climate adaptation efforts. We currently have no equivalent of the mitigation target of “global net-zero” for adaptation. The Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) was established under the Paris Agreement to enhance climate change adaptation by increasing awareness of and funding for countries’ adaptation needs. However, adaptation is primarily a place based, local activity and as such, a global target has been challenging to establish. Investors, therefore, have no “North Star” and find it difficult to know what to invest in, and how to assess the investments success. Adaptation metrics can be difficult to grasp - they are not straightforward like reductions in carbon emissions. Using standardised approaches, like those in Gold Standard and RCC’s Adaptation Requirements, to provide a basis for credible calculation of avoided loss for projects can overcome some of these difficulties for funders and investors"
386,Gold_Standard,1314,". Adaptation metrics can be difficult to grasp - they are not straightforward like reductions in carbon emissions. Using standardised approaches, like those in Gold Standard and RCC’s Adaptation Requirements, to provide a basis for credible calculation of avoided loss for projects can overcome some of these difficulties for funders and investors. The approach is credible despite the current lack of granular adaptation data because it draws on best available scientific information and combines it with the local knowledge of key stakeholders. This means many of the data gaps can be addressed. The approach assures both public and private investors that their investments will continue producing positive impacts well into the future. The Case for Action on Climate Adaptation Investing in climate adaptation is not only a moral obligation, but also a strategic move for businesses, investors, and governments who recognise the role that is needed to be played by finance in addressing climate adaptation. By embracing adaptation, we can enhance resilience and safeguard assets. The moment to be a leading investor in adaptation is today.

The Nature Responsibility Framework, published today at Gold Standard’s Climate Action for People and Nature conference, proposes that companies take responsibility for their nature impacts, outlines how they can take action and highlights tools to deliver on their goals. The Framework helps companies cut through complexity and navigate rapidly evolving guidance. Five key responsibility areas guide users through a set of fundamental principles, actions and recommendations. Margaret Kim, CEO of Gold Standard said: “Many companies aspire to take action on nature but simply lack the direction to get started.

409,Marine_Stewardship_Council,1530,"What is sustainable fishing? Fishing is sustainable if it leaves enough fish in the oceans and minimises impacts on habitats and ecosystems. For this to happen, fisheries must be managed effectively. Why is sustainable fishing important? Communities worldwide rely on fishing for their livelihoods and as a vital source of food and nutrition. More than a third of the global population relies on seafood as a source of protein and 38 million people are employed in wild capture fisheries. If we fish sustainably, we can secure food for the future and help eradicate poverty and hunger. However, unsustainable fishing practices, such as overfishing, unregulated fishing activities and excessive bycatch, are putting our oceans at risk. More than a third of global fisheries have been fished beyond sustainable limits and world demand for seafood continues to grow. Sustainable fishing can reverse this decline and ensure that there are enough fish left in the sea so that fishing can take place indefinitely into the future. The long-term health of fish stocks is also vital to secure a source of nutrient-rich food to feed a growing population. 16 million more tonnes of seafood could be produced every year if fisheries are managed sustainably, providing enough protein to meet the needs of 72 million people worldwide. Certified sustainable wild-capture fishing can also reduce the pressure on land-based agriculture as a source of protein. Seafood also has, on average, a lower carbon footprint than land-based animal proteins."

Since we were founded in 1997, fisheries responsible for 16.5% of marine catch have been certified to the MSC Fisheries Standard. Certification is helping to grow and maintain the number of sustainable fish populations. To remain certified, fisheries have so far made over 2,300 improvements to their performance and management. More than 48,000 sites, including supermarket chains, restaurants, fishmongers and hotels are now certified to sell seafood with the blue MSC label."
411,Marine_Stewardship_Council,490,Organisation: Marine Stewardship Council URL: https://www.msc.org/ Page Title: The MSC Improvement Program | Marine Stewardship Council  The necessity for well-managed fisheries is more urgent than ever and progress needs to be rapid. Fisheries not yet operating at a level that meets the MSC Standard can join the MSC Improvement Program. Fisheries in the Program are expected to improve stock management and environmental impacts so they can meet the Fisheries Standard within five years.
412,Marine_Stewardship_Council,620,Organisation: Marine Stewardship Council URL: https://www.msc.org/ Page Title: What Is Overfishing | Marine Stewardship Council  Overfishing is a serious global problem that threatens ocean wildlife and biodiversity. Loss of marine life brings a further threat to the millions of people who rely on seafood for protein and livelihoods. Overfishing occurs when too many fish in a particular stock are caught and there are not enough adults to breed and sustain a healthy population. The level of overfishing has been increasing in recent decades and the number of overfished stocks is now three times higher than in 1970.

439,PEFC_International,1554,"Webpage Contents: PEFC group certification is our practical solution to make PEFC chain of custody certification feasible for small companies. We are aware that obtaining PEFC chain of custody certification requires resources and effort. For companies with limited resources and capacity to implement a chain of custody system, this can be a barrier to certification. That is why we developed group certification - our practical solution to make chain of custody certification feasible for typically small companies. Group certification is a form of multi-site certification - the certificate holder is the group entity and the small companies are the group members. The group entity can be any legal entity that operates the group management system. Quite often consultants or trade associations with a broad network in the processing sectors take on the role of group entity. The group members are independent of each other and can be from completely different sectors. It is, for example, possible that a group certificate includes sawmills, printers and furniture manufacturers. The only conditions are the size limitations for the individual group members and that they are located in the same country. Benefits for your company Simplified implementation The group entity is the certification consultant for the group members. They are responsible for representing the group certificate in the certification process and performing the internal audits. They are also required to provide all the necessary information and guidance to the group members"

The region currently has an estimated 4 million hectares of oil palm production spread across 22 countries and, as an emerging market for palm oil, accounts for about 5% of global palm oil output and at least 10% of global palm oil demand. At the heart of this expansion in Africa are smallholder farmers who comprise an average of 70% of the total production area. While the expansion of oil palm production represents significant potential for socioeconomic development and poverty reduction, several challenges continue to afflict smallholders, including poor management practices, low yields, and inadequate planting materials. Faced with these challenges, RSPO recently achieved a milestone in Africa — certifying the first Independent Smallholders Group of nearly 5,000 farmers in Sierra Leone"
467,RSPO,1496,". Faced with these challenges, RSPO recently achieved a milestone in Africa — certifying the first Independent Smallholders Group of nearly 5,000 farmers in Sierra Leone. The Ngoyaï Gbaayegie Group, within the catchment area of Goldtree Sierra Leone Ltd., has attained certification for an impressive 4,983 Independent Smallholders, owning a total land area of 8,667 hectares. Currently, they represent the single largest RSPO certified Independent Smallholder group across all producing regions. This milestone was realised through the RSPO Smallholder Support Fund (RSSF), with technical support from the RSPO Secretariat. Goldtree Sierra Leone Ltd., who doubled as the Group Manager, carried out on the ground implementation. To get a closer look at the collaborative efforts behind this achievement, RSPO spoke with Rosine Nsegbe, Group Sustainability manager of Goldtree, who oversaw the RSPO training of the Ngoyaï Gbaayegie Group. She discusses the main challenges and key lessons learned during the process that eventually led to Milestone B certification; the final phase in the Independent Smallholder Standard’s stepwise certification approach. Smallholders are fueling the momentum of the oil palm industry boom in Africa.

468,RSPO,1463,". Smallholders are fueling the momentum of the oil palm industry boom in Africa. Yet African smallholders are faced with many challenges — could you tell us about some of their most critical challenges? The main challenges of African smallholders are, first of all, the poor yield as a result of the variety and quality of the fruit they grow. Secondly, poor infrastructure and challenges of having market access in order to distribute their fruit, due to bad road networks. We are also using the orthodox system of production and processing of the Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFBs), which deviates from the application of best management practices and good agricultural processes. A majority of the farmers also use fire for land preparation — this is due to the lack of financial resources to acquire labour or mechanical tools to conduct the land preparation. We also have logging for the production of charcoal used for domestic purposes and for additional incomes in their livelihood. Another challenge is the high level of illiteracy among farmers, which makes it difficult to properly record their production and other farm activities. There is also the high cost of the certification process, such as purchasing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), training, certification costs, etc. This is difficult to attain for the smallholders without support from larger growers, companies or other institutions, so the smallholders need more support from external bodies"
469,RSPO,1520,". There is also the high cost of the certification process, such as purchasing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), training, certification costs, etc. This is difficult to attain for the smallholders without support from larger growers, companies or other institutions, so the smallholders need more support from external bodies. The last challenge is the vast diversity of the smallholders, which makes it difficult to standardise since they are opposed to working with them. What specific training was given to the smallholders of the Ngoyaï Gbaayegie Group to address some of these challenges? We conducted several training sessions to address these challenges, such as training on RSPO best management and good agricultural practices, training on health and safety, training on the use of fire and waste management, including emergency response. We gave them several training sessions on financial literacy, and on the benefits of being in a sustainable group. As part of the RSPO training, we taught them about High Conservation Value (HCV), social sustainability, legal labour practices, and also how to develop and implement the group management plan, and to work efficiently within their group. We trained a total of 7,424 smallholders but we certified just 4,983. Nevertheless, we are preparing everyone to achieve certification. How long were the training sessions for such a large group of smallholders? A session of training is one day, from morning to afternoon, which was carried out for eight to 10 weeks"
470,RSPO,1226,". We trained a total of 7,424 smallholders but we certified just 4,983. Nevertheless, we are preparing everyone to achieve certification. How long were the training sessions for such a large group of smallholders? A session of training is one day, from morning to afternoon, which was carried out for eight to 10 weeks. The training takes place at the various Farmer Field School (FFS) centres, the group has 160 centres with an average of 50 farmers per FFS. The training sessions are conducted by the group of Internal Control System Officers (ICSO), we have 16 groups of 2 ICSO. To cover our topics, we took 10 days per group of Internal Control System Officers (ICSO). How did the smallholders first react to the training, initially? Was there pushback or any kind of resistance at first? From day one the farmers were very excited about the training and requested for more of such training. However, some of the challenges of the training process were that the sessions were long — this affected the level of concentration of the farmers. Sometimes, the distance they needed to travel to come to the training and the transport reimbursement was also an issue. But other than that, there was no resistance for the training"

Sometimes, the distance they needed to travel to come to the training and the transport reimbursement was also an issue. But other than that, there was no resistance for the training. What are the key lessons to take away from this experience and for Goldtree achieving this milestone certification from RSPO? The key lessons for this experience for Goldtree achieving this certification are, firstly, that there is a need for more funding for the smallholders, as it is very expensive to achieve smallholder inclusion for the production of sustainable palm oil, such as the cost of PPE, cost of training, cost to map the farms, developing and establishing the farmers’ support centre and the farmers’ field school, etc. There is also a need to have a well-structured farmer organisation and a very good internal control system to monitor the activity of the group. Finally, good managers should demonstrate a good understanding of the Independent Smallholder Standard and have the capacity to develop a good business plan for the smallholders, which is the key point of the smallholders’ project. Is there any personal story you’d like to share regarding the training and certification process?

522,RSPO,1543,". As well as a widely used cooking oil, it’s found in countless supermarket products, from soap and toothpaste to chocolate and pot noodles. Palm oil is extracted from the flesh and the kernel of the oil palm fruit. Its popularity for cooking and as a combining ingredient springs from its diverse range of properties. Smooth and tasteless, it can also: Hold its colour well Stay solid at room temperature (to help baked goods last longer) Remove oil and dirt Moisturise hair and skin Make soaps and detergents bubbly Oil palms have much higher yields than any other vegetable oil crops. Productivity is its standout quality – they require four to ten times less land than other vegetable oil crops to get the same amount of oil. That efficient use of land makes palm oil attractive to producers and buyers around the world. The challenge with palm oil Despite its unique qualities as a product and its high demand, palm oil has a mixed reputation. When produced unsustainably, it can have negative impacts – on the environment, on wildlife and on human rights. Irresponsible production of palm oil has damaging environmental and social effects – forests have been cleared or destroyed to grow palm oil, harming natural habitats, vulnerable flora and fauna, as well as local communities. Many farmers and labourers producing palm oil amidst unsustainable conditions have suffered from unfair labour practices and low pay. Because of these negative impacts, there have been calls to boycott palm oil. Yet boycotting palm oil is not the solution"
523,RSPO,1516,". Many farmers and labourers producing palm oil amidst unsustainable conditions have suffered from unfair labour practices and low pay. Because of these negative impacts, there have been calls to boycott palm oil. Yet boycotting palm oil is not the solution. Switching to alternative vegetable oils from palm oil wouldn’t reduce these impacts – sunflower, rapeseed and soy have much lower yields per hectare than oil palm, so more land would be needed to produce an equivalent amount of oil. What’s more, millions of farmers and their families around the world make a living on oil palm plantations and smallholdings. This provides them with the income for basic essentials such as food, clean water, housing, and their children’s education. A hectare of oil palms will yield more than twice the oil of a hectare of sunflowers – British Beauty Council. Sustainable Beauty Coalition: Palm Oil. 2021. A sustainable solution We live in a world in which population growth and climate change threaten global food security as never before. Sustainable palm oil has an important part to play in relieving this pressure. The emphasis is on “sustainable.” Sustainable palm oil has been farmed, processed, distributed, and sold responsibly with strict rules that protect animals, the environment and people who live and work in oil palm producing countries.

Most of the materials used for fashion, textile, and apparel today come from farms, forests, or fossil fuels. Textile Exchange exists to ensure the industry treats these resources with respect. Our purpose is to build a global fiber and materials production model that positively impacts our planet. At the heart of our strategy is the goal of helping the fashion, textile, and apparel industry to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that come from fiber and raw materials production by 45% by 2030. We call it Climate+. Soil puts food on our plates, purifies the water, and is the beginning of all material production. We’re striving to keep it healthy. Like food and the air we breathe, material production depends on healthy ecosystems which need a wide variety of animals, plants, and microorganisms. That’s why we’re supporting biodiversity. The basis of life as we know it, water, needs to be treated as the precious resource it is. We work to make sure it is used responsibly and put back safely into our systems. We help the industry to understand some of the common sustainability challenges that come with producing popular fibers and raw materials. Then, we work with stakeholders all along the supply chain to find ways to overcome them at scale. We’ve developed a set of robust standards to give the industry a way to authenticate their sustainability claims from raw material to final product"

It’s important because raw materials often travel all around the world to be spun, dyed, woven, cut, and sewn. By having your product certified to a third-party content claim standard like ours, you can make sure that at every stage along this journey, all necessary measures have been taken to ensure that what goes in, comes out. The Content Claim Standard (CCS) is our chain of custody standard, and it underpins our whole standard system. According to the CCS, certification is needed at every stage of the supply chain. Brands benefit from increased traceability, ensuring you “get what you paid for,” and it shows you’re pursuing real and meaningful change."

Commitment claims may be made after a company has registered a commitment to one or more of our standards through our online form. Assured claims are only for organizations or products that have met the requirements of an “assurance process.” Informational statements are ready-to-use messages that describe a relevant standard.

Both the British Dietetic Association and the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recognise that they are suitable for every age and stage of life. Some research has linked that there are certain health benefits to vegan diets with lower blood pressure and cholesterol, and lower rates of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer. Going vegan is a great opportunity to learn more about nutrition and cooking, and improve your diet. Getting your nutrients from plant foods allows more room in your diet for health-promoting options like whole grains, fruit, nuts, seeds and vegetables, which are packed full of beneficial fibre, vitamins and minerals.

For the environment From recycling our household rubbish to cycling to work, we're all aware of ways to live a greener life. One of the most effective things an individual can do to lower their carbon footprint is to avoid all animal products. This goes way beyond the problem of cow flatulence and air pollution! Why is meat and dairy so bad for the environment? The production of meat and other animal derived products places a heavy burden on the environment. The vast amount of grain feed required for meat production is a significant contributor to deforestation, habitat loss and species extinction. In Brazil alone, the equivalent of 5.6 million acres of land is used to grow soya beans for animals in Europe. This land contributes to developing world malnutrition by driving impoverished populations to grow cash crops for animal feed, rather than food for themselves. On the other hand, considerably lower quantities of crops and water are required to sustain a vegan diet, making the switch to veganism one of the easiest, most enjoyable and most effective ways to reduce our impact on the environment. For more on how veganism is the way forward for the environment, see our environment section. Find out more about going vegan for the environment. For people Just like veganism is the sustainable option when it comes to looking after our planet, plant-based living is also a more sustainable way of feeding the human family.

For people Just like veganism is the sustainable option when it comes to looking after our planet, plant-based living is also a more sustainable way of feeding the human family. A plant-based diet requires only one third of the land needed to support a meat and dairy diet. With rising global food and water insecurity due to a myriad of environmental and socio-economic problems, there's never been a better time to adopt a more sustainable way of living. Avoiding animal products is not just one of the simplest ways an individual can reduce the strain on food as well as other resources, it's the simplest way to take a stand against inefficient food systems which disproportionately affect the poorest people all over the world.

Why vegetarian isn't enough The suffering caused by the dairy and egg industry is possibly less well publicised than the plight of factory farmed animals. The production of dairy products necessitates the death of countless male calves that are of no use to the dairy farmer, as well as the premature death of cows slaughtered when their milk production decreases. Similarly, in egg production, even 'ethical' or 'free range' eggs involve the killing of the 'unnecessary' male chicks when just a day old. Ethical meat? It's tempting to want to believe that the meat we eat is ethical, that our 'food animals' have lived full, happy lives and that they have experienced no pain or fear at the slaughterhouse. Yet the sad truth is that all living creatures fear death, just as we do. No matter how they are treated when alive, whether they are raised on a factory farm, or labelled as 'free range' or 'organic', they all experience the same fear when it comes to slaughter. The good news The good news is there IS something we can do about it. Every time we shop or order food in a restaurant - every time we eat - we can choose to help these animals. Every time we make the switch from an animal product to a vegan alternative we are standing up for farmed animals everywhere.

596,The_Vegan_Society,727,". The environmental impact of dietary choices and animal agriculture however, is often markedly absent from this debate. We have therefore been campaigning for politicians to recognise the role of veganism in tackling the climate crisis, by adopting policies that encourage plant-based diets and support our existing campaigns. Did you know? The UN IPCC says that the world needs to reach net zero CO₂ emissions by 2050, and net zero other GHG emissions (such as methane and nitrous oxide) by 2070 Co-ordinated and substantive actions by Governments – and the largest institutions, corporations, and land managers – are vital for net zero emissions. The global contribution of animal farming to GHG emissions is agreed to be 14"
597,The_Vegan_Society,1512,". The global contribution of animal farming to GHG emissions is agreed to be 14.5% - more than the direct emissions from all transport combined The UK provides good conditions for growing plant proteins for direct human consumption to counter this, such as fava beans, peas, hemp seed or sweet lupin In response to the Climate Emergency declaration, formal letters signed by our Chief Executive were sent to major political parties – including Labour, Liberal Democrats, SNP, Welsh Government & UK Parliament - advocating for policies that incorporate the following three steps: Encourage the nation to adopt an increasingly plant-based diet Implement policies for public sector institutions such as schools, hospitals and care homes to offer vegan meals as standard on menus every day - part of the Catering for Everyone campaign Provide financial and practical support for farmers who wish to move away from livestock farming, to growing crops for direct human consumption - part of the Grow Green campaign There is now leading evidence to support such measures - the Committee for Climate Change have directly stated that the 'public sector should take a strong lead by providing plant-based options in schools and hospitals' to encourage nutritious and sustainable diets, and the International Panel on Climate Change have explicitly highlighted that a vegan diet has the highest GHG mitigation potential.

606,The_Vegan_Society,1520,". In certain areas, livestock production has increased massively; there are now 4 and a half times as many tonnes of pig produced in 2013 compared to 1961, while world chicken production has increased by nearly 13 times. These harrowing numbers are growing. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations predicts that by 2050 world meat production will have almost doubled, as the Western taste for meat, eggs and dairy products continues to grow (along with our waistlines). This trend will continue to contribute to global warming, widespread pollution, deforestation, land degradation, water scarcity and species extinction. More animals mean more crops are needed to feed them: the planet cannot feed both increasing human and farmed animal populations, especially when there will be between 2-4 billion more human mouths to feed by 2050. If we are trying to reduce our car use, limit the amount of water we waste, become more ‘energy-efficient’ and generally lessen our environmental impact, we must also examine the most important factor of our personal ecological footprint: what we eat.

Vegan and plant-based diets use less resources Food (and land) security is becoming a major issue. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that one in nine people are chronically undernourished. With the world’s population expected to increase from 7 billion to reach 9-11 billion by 2050, one of the most urgent questions we now face is how we, as a species, will feed ourselves in the 21st century. Even if we tackled the economic forces that ultimately cause the unfair allocation of resources, land availability would still be one of the main constraints on mass food production. The Earth has only a limited area of viable agricultural land; how this land is used is central to our ability to feed the world. This is particularly important given how desertification and other ecological issues brought on by climate change continue to reduce the quantity and the quality of the world's arable land. Meat-heavy, Westernised diets are a waste of resources we desperately need to conserve. This is because farmed animals consume much more protein, water and calories than they 'produce'"
608,The_Vegan_Society,1421,". This is particularly important given how desertification and other ecological issues brought on by climate change continue to reduce the quantity and the quality of the world's arable land. Meat-heavy, Westernised diets are a waste of resources we desperately need to conserve. This is because farmed animals consume much more protein, water and calories than they 'produce'. Most of the protein from vegetable feed is used for the animal’s bodily functions and not 'converted' to meat, eggs or milk. How your diet can help Quite simply, we do not have enough land to feed a growing population an animal-based diet. While 800 million people do not have enough food, we continue to waste valuable agricultural land by obtaining only a small fraction of its potential calorific value. The world’s population is increasing and viable agricultural lands are diminishing. If we are to avoid future global food scarcity we must find sustainable ways of utilising our natural resource base. Industrial livestock production is not just unsustainable; it's unjustifiable. Vegans use less water globally The world will only have 60% of the water it needs by 2030 without significant global policy change, according to a recent report from the U.N. This situation is predicted to worsen as our population expands and consumption per capita increases with more and more people adopting resource-intensive Western meat eating habits"
609,The_Vegan_Society,1532,". Vegans use less water globally The world will only have 60% of the water it needs by 2030 without significant global policy change, according to a recent report from the U.N. This situation is predicted to worsen as our population expands and consumption per capita increases with more and more people adopting resource-intensive Western meat eating habits. How your diet can help use less water Although statistics vary, it is safe to say that it takes at least three times the amount of water to feed a meat eater compared with that used to feed a vegan. For example, it takes 15,500 litres of water to produce 1 kg beef, contrasted with 180 litres for 1 kg tomatoes and 250 litres for 1 kg potatoes. Consuming animal products is incredibly resource-intensive. Globally, farming uses about 70% of the planet’s accessible freshwater. This is compared to around 20% for industry, and about 10% for domestic use. This is largely because arable land has to be irrigated to make it agriculturally viable and to increase and improve crop yields. As has been shown, much of this land is entirely wasted by growing feed crops for livestock rather than food for direct consumption by people. The water used on this land – as well as that consumed direct by livestock – represents yet another wasted resource. Since a large percentage of the crops fed to European farmed animals are grown in developing countries, this wasted water comes not only from European reserves but also from the very countries where drinking water is most scarce"
610,The_Vegan_Society,1545,". The water used on this land – as well as that consumed direct by livestock – represents yet another wasted resource. Since a large percentage of the crops fed to European farmed animals are grown in developing countries, this wasted water comes not only from European reserves but also from the very countries where drinking water is most scarce. Switching to a vegan diet will help significantly reduce the world’s water requirements. Water pollution Agriculture is also the number one water polluter. Slurry from cattle and other livestock pollutes groundwater, streams and rivers. The livestock sector is probably the largest sectoral source of water pollution. Manure and slurry contain high levels of nitrogen and phosphor. These elements can leach into groundwater and run off to pollute lakes, killing the fish and endangering the health of other animals. Ammonia is also given off and can cause acid rain. Demand for animal feed is one of the major reasons behind the intensification of crop production. Stop the demand – go vegan!

647,The_Vegan_Society,1578,"."" Vegan Trademark Standards The Vegan Trademark is the authentic international vegan standard and is managed by The Vegan Society; the charity that created the word 'vegan' back in 1944. Our dedicated and experienced vegan team check each product application against the below criteria, working with manufacturers and suppliers across a range of fields to ensure that each product meets the highest vegan standards. The Vegan Trademark is renewed on a yearly basis to ensure we have the most up to date information on all the products we certify. Animals The Vegan Society understands the word 'animal' to refer to the entire animal kingdom. That is all vertebrates and all multicellular invertebrates. 'Animal' can refer to a species or an individual; and is used as a noun or an adjective, as required. Unless otherwise stated, it usually means non-human animals. Animal ingredients The manufacture and/or development of the product, and its ingredients, must not involve or have involved, the use of any animal product, by-product or derivative. Animal testing The development and/or manufacture of the product, and its ingredients, must not involve or have involved testing of any sort on animals conducted at the initiative of the company or on its behalf, or by parties over whom the company has effective control. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) The development and/or production of GMOs must not have involved animal genes or animal-derived substances. Products put forward for trademark registration that contains or may contain any GMOs must be labelled as such"

Products put forward for trademark registration that contains or may contain any GMOs must be labelled as such. Kitchen and hygiene standards Any dishes that are to be labelled vegan must be prepared separately from non-vegan dishes. At a minimum, this means thoroughly washing surfaces and utensils before using them for vegan cooking. We strongly recommend obtaining a separate set of cleaning utensils for this purpose. We ask for the awareness of the risk of cross-contamination from non-vegan sources in your kitchen or production line, and that the Trademark holder takes all reasonable and practical steps to eliminate this.

658,UK_Gov,1587,"Organisation: UK Gov URL: https://greenclaims.campaign.gov.uk/ Page Title: Check your Green Claims - Green claims code  Many businesses are already doing the right thing by being upfront about how green a product really is. But that’s not always the case. A recent international analysis of websites found that 40% of green claims made online could be misleading. That’s why we’ve created the Green Claims Code, to help you ensure your green claims are genuine and not misleading. Not only will it help you protect your business’ reputation with its customers, but it will also help you to stay on the right side of the law. Green claims must: 1. Be truthful and accurate: Businesses must live up to the claims they make about their products, services, brands and activities. 2. Be clear and unambiguous: The meaning that a consumer is likely to take from a product’s messaging and the credentials of that product should match. 3. Not omit or hide important information: Claims must not prevent someone from making an informed choice because of the information they leave out. 4. Only make fair and meaningful comparisons: Any products compared should meet the same needs or be intended for the same purpose. 5. Consider the full life cycle of the product: When making claims, businesses must consider the total impact of a product or service. Claims can be misleading where they don’t reflect the overall impact or where they focus on one aspect of it but not another. 6. Be substantiated: Businesses should be able to back up their claims with robust, credible and up to date evidence."

660,UK_Gov,1596,"To help consumers to identify genuine environmental claims about products and services that they are considering purchasing we’ve created a series of tips. The tips are designed to encourage consumers to ask themselves some simple questions when they see an environmental claim. Where possible, we would encourage consumers to be wary of vague claims and demand more information from businesses about their goods and services for which they claim environmental benefits. 1. Do not trust slogans or vague terms. Phrases such as ‘all natural’, ‘green’ and ‘eco’ sound nice but they don’t provide clear meaning and can leave room for misinterpretation. Be wary of any claims that are not easily defined or supported by adequate information. Businesses should make it easy for you to tell how they, their product or service provides a benefit, or is less harmful to, the environment. If you aren’t sure, check the ingredients, or supporting information, and research anything you are not familiar with. 2. Look for evidence to support a claim. If you are unsure a claim is legitimate, check it by reading the small print or go to the company website for evidence. It should not be difficult to find proof to support a claim made by a company with genuine environmentally friendly practices. A good form of proof is a reputable certification mark which indicates an alliance with an environmental standards scheme. You can find out more about these by searching online. You should also consider if the information provided is relevant to the product or service you are buying. 3. Look past appearances"
661,UK_Gov,1382,". A good form of proof is a reputable certification mark which indicates an alliance with an environmental standards scheme. You can find out more about these by searching online. You should also consider if the information provided is relevant to the product or service you are buying. 3. Look past appearances. Images of wildlife, or a logo with a leaf, can easily convince you that you’re making an environmentally friendly choice. Even the use of earthy, natural tones or a green font can give the impression a product or service is good for the environment. But that might not be the case when you look a little closer. Don’t just rely on the marketing. Read the full description. 4. Don’t forget the disposal. Think about what you will do with both the packaging, and the product when you have finished with it. It should be clear whether any environmental claim about how to dispose of these relates to the product, packaging, or both. Check you fully understand how to dispose of the packaging and product. For example, is it recyclable and which bin you should use to do so? 5. Think about the bigger picture. A product or service may claim to be environmentally friendly. But this doesn’t mean all its elements, or its overall impact, are positive for the environment. There could be information that a business doesn’t tell you. Consider the overall environmental impact."

663,UK_Gov,1507,"Fashion customers are increasingly demanding products and services that do less harm to or benefit the environment. It’s important that they can make informed choices based on claims they can trust. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has published this guide to help fashion businesses stay on the right side of consumer law. Drawing on lessons from our recent investigation into ASOS, Boohoo and George at Asda, we explain how you can follow the Green Claims Code when making environmental (or ‘green’) claims. This guide focuses on retailers but is also relevant to those who manufacture or distribute products. Wherever you are in the supply chain, you’re responsible for making sure your claims are accurate and backed up. If you don’t, you risk breaking the law, having to pay back your customers, and significant harm to your business’s reputation. All your green claims must be clear and accurate. This is the case whether they’re made on a product (including on labels), in advertising, in store or online. Don’t hide important information. Instead: use plain language, make it clearly visible, present in a way that customers can easily understand, put it close to the green claim you make. Customers should not have to do something, like follow a hyperlink or scan a QR code, to find this information. It should be on the same side of a tag, or next to a claim on a website. It shouldn’t contradict the claim either. Avoid using unclear terms like ‘green’, ‘sustainable’ or ‘eco-friendly’"

Green claims (sometimes called ‘environmental claims’ or ‘eco-friendly claims’) are claims that show how a product, service, brand or business provides a benefit or is less harmful to the environment. Many businesses use green claims to help market their products or services. They do this through a range of methods such as: statements, symbols, emblems, logos, graphics, colours and product brand names. 40% of green claims made online could be misleading."

Upcycled products prevent food waste by creating new, high quality products out of surplus food. It’s an innovative approach to food waste because it is the first consumer product-based solution, making it highly scalable and economically sustainable. Upcycling food is an ancient tradition based on the philosophy of using all of what you have. It's about doing more with less, and elevating all food to its highest and best use. Most of all, upcycled food is about reducing food waste, by creating high quality, nutritious food products out of the nutrients that slip through the cracks of our food system. But what is 'upcycled food' technically? A team of experts from Harvard Law School, Drexel University, World Wildlife Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council, ReFED, and others officially defined “upcycled food” in 2020 for use in policy, research, and more: “Upcycled foods use ingredients that otherwise would not have gone to human consumption, are procured and produced using verifiable supply chains, and have a positive impact on the environment.” To learn more about the definition of ""upcycled food,"" watch a recording of the public webinar we held in June 2020.

The task force also produced a summary paper, which explains the following definition elements: 1. Upcycled foods are made from ingredients that would otherwise have ended up in a food waste destination. According to the Food Loss and Waste Protocol, the food waste destinations are when food ends up in places like incinerators, as animal feed, in landfills, or in anaerobic digesters. By avoiding these destinations, upcycled food makes better use of the energy expended in growing, transporting, and preparing that food. 8% of human-cause greenhouse gas emissions come from food loss and waste, which is why reducing food waste is considered the single greatest solution to climate change according to Project Drawdown. 2. Upcycled foods are value-added products. Globally, we lose around $1 trillion USD per year on food that is wasted or lost. Upcycled food captures that value, and leverages it to create a sustainable and resilient food system. 3. Upcycled foods are for human consumption. Upcycled food is all about elevating food to its highest and best use. Upcycled foods are for human consumption, but upcycled ingredients could also be included in animal feed, pet food, cosmetics, home or personal care, and more. 4.

Upcycled foods have an auditable supply chain. 28% of agricultural land goes to grow food that is never eaten. The auditable supply chain ensures that upcycled food is truly helping to reduce waste by utilizing all the nutrients grown on farms, helping farmers get more value out of their land. Upcycled food will help to feed a growing population without increasing deforestation or putting extra pressure on the environment. 5. Upcycled foods indicate which ingredients are upcycled on their labels. Upcycled food gives everyday people the ability to vote with their dollars to end food waste. By indicating which ingredients are upcycled, consumers know they are spending their money in a way that aligns with their values."

If you manufacture or sell clothing or household items that contain any wool, including specialty wools like cashmere, you must comply with the Wool Products Labeling Act.

Broad claims are difficult to substantiate, if not impossible. Marketers should qualify general claims with specific environmental benefits.

We ask for an annual licensing fee of each company (not for each product) for use of the trademarked “Certified Vegan” logo. The licensing fee is assessed by the company’s annual revenue from the previous fiscal year (not based on the vegan product or brand) and is due before permission is granted to use the “Certified Vegan” logo. The licensing fee helps support the Vegan Certification program and promotes vegan products worldwide! FAQ Frequently Asked Questions How do I certify my company and vegan products? Submit an application through our online form . NOTE: We do not certify companies, restaurants, food trucks, farms, or manufacturers – we certify individual products. Why do you charge money for the certification? Licensing fees help fund the certification program, protect the legitimacy and proper use of the trademark, and assure that the certification program will continue in the future. We charge an annual licensing fee (for an unlimited number of products/skus) based on the company's annual revenue from the previous fiscal year. What is the time frame for completing certification?

We politely ask that you do not inquire by phone or email as we will contact you once a Vegan Certifier begins to review your application. Do you accept products that contain refined sugar? We do not allow sugar (or other sweeteners) that are refined through bone char to carry the Certified Vegan Logo. Any companies that use cane sugar, beet sugar, corn syrup, coconut sugar, date sugar, molasses, agave, maple syrup, or brown rice syrup in their products must send a statement from the sugar supplier that guarantees that they do not use animal products in the production of that sweetener. What about fertilizers, do you make sure animal products are not in fertilizers? We do not request or require documentation on fertilizers that are used on food products that are Vegan Certified. In addition to that being impossible for most companies to even attain that information, we recognize that all natural soil has animal waste and animal detritus present. Are Certified Vegan Products ""veganic"" or confirmed to not be grown with animal by-products?

We do not take into account soil, fertilizer, or farming practices when reviewing documentation for Vegan Certification. If we were to account for animal by-products in outdoor soil and farming practices, then nothing would qualify as vegan. We base our Certified Vegan standards on ingredients, animal testing, and processes for individual ingredients and the final product. We started the Certified Vegan Campaign for ethical reasons (to reduce the greatest harm to animals and those are ones bred and raised for food) and to make it easier to become vegan and choose vegan products. We want to support companies making a genuine effort in making vegan products and we don't want it to be an impossible venture as that would not serve anyone. Why do you accept products that are manufactured on shared machinery? We do allow companies to use shared machinery (machinery that also runs products containing animal products/ingredients) in the production of their products, but most of those products carry a label that says so. Companies must provide documentation of the steps that are taken to thoroughly clean the machinery. Even though the machines are guaranteed to be cleaned thoroughly between non-vegan and vegan batches, shared machinery may contain trace amounts of eggs or dairy for example. For this reason, a Vegan Certified Product may not be acceptable to individuals with food allergies"

Even though the machines are guaranteed to be cleaned thoroughly between non-vegan and vegan batches, shared machinery may contain trace amounts of eggs or dairy for example. For this reason, a Vegan Certified Product may not be acceptable to individuals with food allergies. The vegan definition is political - it describes one dedicated to reducing the suffering and death of animals and destruction of the planet. People do not choose a vegan diet for purist reasons or for food allergy reasons. People choose a plant-based diet for health reasons, religious reasons, or allergy reasons. The Certified Vegan Logo is to help you buy items that are cruelty free. That is the motivation behind our work so that you can vote with your dollar against animal agriculture. In addition, many vegan companies lease non-vegan kitchens and equipment from other companies to produce their products and many companies make vegan and non-vegan items on the same machines. It is extremely expensive for these small companies to purchase dedicated vegan machinery of their own. In fact, many vegan companies may not exist if they had to purchase their own equipment. When we were starting the Vegan Certification Campaign we had to establish what was going to be considered vegan. Most products with vegan ingredients would not be considered vegan under the strictest standards because of some form of processing contamination"
715,Vegan_Action,1511,". In fact, many vegan companies may not exist if they had to purchase their own equipment. When we were starting the Vegan Certification Campaign we had to establish what was going to be considered vegan. Most products with vegan ingredients would not be considered vegan under the strictest standards because of some form of processing contamination. We decided that we would not exclude products that may possibly contain trace amounts of contamination. We consulted with other prominent vegan organizations and we all agree that vegan purity is more harmful than helpful. Our motivation is working to end cruelty to animals and we don’t feel that avoiding trace amounts of animal products in vegan foods helps end animal suffering. It is far better for the animals that these vegan products exist. It is far better for people to realize that they have vegan options instead of nothing. If there were fewer vegan options how many people would become vegan? We are working to end cruelty to animals by showing the non-vegan food industry that there is a market for vegan products. Once there are more vegan products available, more people will want to become vegan. As more people become vegan, more companies will make more vegan products and will be able to afford dedicated machinery. As it stands now, most people think veganism is too hard, restrictive, and expensive. When more vegan food is available it will be easier to find cheaper vegan options so people will find it easy and accessible to be vegan"

In addition, protein is an essential nutrient that is necessary for the growth and maintenance of muscles and other organ tissues, and it is important for companies to be able to make protein claims on their product packaging. In order for companies in the U.S. to make a protein claim on their packaging, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has required that they include percent Daily Value for protein in the nutrition panel on the package for all proteins, and more recently, all plant-based proteins, such as pea protein. However, the %DV must be based on the “corrected protein value” not the amount that is simply declared on the Nutrition Facts Panel. This corrected value utilizes the PDCAAS. PDCAAS, or Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score, evaluates a food's protein quality. It's a method of evaluating the quality of a protein based on both the amino acid requirements of humans and their ability to digest it. The PDCAAS has been adopted by FAO/WHO as the preferred method for the measurement of the protein value in human nutrition. Beginning in 2014, the FDA mandated the use of animals in feed trials to determine the PDCAAS. The protein is fed to a test animal in order to collect and evaluate their feces.

It's a method of evaluating the quality of a protein based on both the amino acid requirements of humans and their ability to digest it. The PDCAAS has been adopted by FAO/WHO as the preferred method for the measurement of the protein value in human nutrition. Beginning in 2014, the FDA mandated the use of animals in feed trials to determine the PDCAAS. The protein is fed to a test animal in order to collect and evaluate their feces. This is considered animal research and is not consistent with Vegan Action’s guidelines of No Animal Testing prior to the year 2009 in order for a product to be approved for Vegan Certification. As an animal welfare organization, first and foremost, we had to make a decision whether or not we should consider and approve products for the Certified Vegan designation if they contain plant-based protein ingredients that have been PDCAAS tested but they would otherwise meet our criteria. We conducted our own independent search for non-animal tested plant protein manufacturers and were unable to find any that met our guidelines and the demand required of companies. Despite the animal feed trial requirement, we made the decision to accept these ingredients for several reasons. First, these companies unfortunately do not have an alternative; every major manufacturer of plant-proteins has now conducted these animal feed trials so that their ingredients are FDA compliant"

First, these companies unfortunately do not have an alternative; every major manufacturer of plant-proteins has now conducted these animal feed trials so that their ingredients are FDA compliant. Second, we know how access to a multitude of vegan options, especially products that carry the Certified Vegan logo, makes it easier for people to opt for plant-based foods. Third, we know that suddenly labeling plant-based protein products as “not vegan acceptable” will deter people from choosing plant protein options, in direct opposition to our organization’s goal. This will maintain unethically high levels of animal suffering within the food industry and harm the movement towards a better world where less animals are eaten. Finally, once manufacturers have completed the PDCAAS evaluations, the FDA does not require repeated animal feed trials to maintain product compliance. We recognize not everyone will be in full agreement of this decision, however we truly believe this determination is in the best interest of the animals and hope you will continue to support our work.

What about the Impossible Burger, could that be Vegan Certified? While the Impossible Burger is completely free of animal products in ingredients, there is one ingredient that was recently tested on animals and therefore it would not qualify for Vegan Certification. We recognize that this product is really popular with meat-eaters and has replaced many cow burgers being purchased over years having a significant positive impact for the animals. Can Cultured Meat be Vegan Certified? While we greatly support the cultured meat movement and will encourage folks to choose it over factory farmed animals, we will not Vegan Certify cultured meat due to our guidelines. Because animal cells and/or proteins are required for growing the product, it would not meet our Certified Vegan requirements of ""not being sourced from animal products or animal by-products."" We believe this option will soon be a viable, affordable, and accessible option that will reduce animal suffering and death as well as detrimental impacts to the environment.
