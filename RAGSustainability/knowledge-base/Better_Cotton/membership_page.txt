As key players in apparel and textiles, and in direct contact with consumers, Better Cotton Retailer and Brand Members play a vital role in creating demand for more sustainable cotton. Our more than 350 Retailer and Brand Members are based in 34 countries, and together, they are part of a global movement catalysing change with a shared goal of improving cotton production. In 2023, they sourced 2.5 million tonnes of Better Cotton. Becoming a member is a central part of developing a more sustainable material sourcing strategy, enabling retailers and brands to make strides on credible, responsible sourcing programmes and meet ambitious sustainability targets. In addition to supporting a flourishing global market for more sustainable cotton by sourcing Better Cotton, Retailer and Brand Membersâ€™ fees support the implementation of Better Cotton Programmes, which offer field-level advice and training on more sustainable practices for farmers.
