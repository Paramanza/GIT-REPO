Pesticides are the main form of crop protection used around the world. While they serve a vital purpose in controlling pests and safeguarding yields, their negative consequences are not to be taken lightly. Cotton farming accounts for 4.7% of the world’s pesticide and 10% of its insecticides sales. According to one study, around 44% of farmers are poisoned by pesticides every year. With IPM, the presence of pests does not automatically lead to the use of control measures, and when control measures are necessary, non-chemical methods such as biopesticides or traps are the first choice — conventional pesticides are a last resort. By 2030, we want to reduce the use and risk of synthetic pesticides applied by Better Cotton Farmers and workers by at least 50%.
