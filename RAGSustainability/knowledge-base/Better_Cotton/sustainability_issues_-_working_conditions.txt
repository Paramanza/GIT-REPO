Page Title: sustainability issues - working conditions

At Better Cotton, we believe that all farmers and workers have the right to decent work — productive work that offers fair income and wages, security, social protection, equal opportunities, freedom to organise, express concerns, participate in decision-making and negotiate dignified conditions of employment. We recognise that Better Cotton is only ‘better’ if it improves the wellbeing of farmers and their communities, fostering decent work opportunities for rural populations, as well as promoting a safe and healthy environment. Cotton Production and Decent Work — Why it Matters: More than 70% of global cotton is produced by smallholder farmers. Smallholders around the world face multiple challenges in accessing decent work, starting with poverty and deeply entrenched structural inequalities, and ranging from market barriers to climate shocks.
