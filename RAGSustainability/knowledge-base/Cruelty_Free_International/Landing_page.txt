Cruelty Free International works to create a world where no animals suffer in a laboratory. Exposing the Unthinkable Help fund the undercover investigations that expose hidden cruelty like Vivotecnia. Graphic footage from our 2021 investigation into the Vivotecnia lab in Spain has now been featured in the new Prime Video documentary Infiltrada en el BÃºnker, revealing horrific cruelty. Your donation powers life-changing investigations. Help us end animal testing. The Cruelty Free International Leaping Bunny is the globally-recognisable gold standard for cosmetics, personal care and household products. Hundreds of brands are approved cruelty free under our Leaping Bunny programme.
