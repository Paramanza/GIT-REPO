Page Title: animal testing facts

We estimate that at least 192.1 million animals were used for scientific purposes worldwide in 2015. This is the worldâ€™s most reliable figure to date. This includes nearly 80 million experiments on animals as well as millions of other animals who are killed for their tissues, used to breed genetically modified animal strains and bred but not used. The latest report from the European Commission shows that 9.3 million experiments were conducted on animals across the EU and Norway in 2022. Additionally, an estimated 207,724 tests using dogs and 158,780 tests using monkeys were conducted in 2015.
