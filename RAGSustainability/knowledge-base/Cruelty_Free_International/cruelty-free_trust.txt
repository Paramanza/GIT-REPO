Page Title: cruelty-free trust

Unlike Cruelty Free International, our sister organisation Cruelty Free International Trust is a registered charity (Charity No. 1081183). The Cruelty Free International Trust charitable objectives are: researching alternatives to animal experiments, ensuring laws controlling animal experiments are properly complied with, educating people about animal experiments. These areas of work are distinct from the work Cruelty Free International carries out â€“ which includes lobbying governments, investigations, media activity and promoting cruelty free products.
