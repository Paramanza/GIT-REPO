Page Title: go cruelty-free

Hundreds of cosmetics, personal care and household brands are approved cruelty free under our Leaping Bunny programme. Itâ€™s the best assurance that a company has made a genuine commitment to help end animal testing. Brands must meet rigorous criteria which apply globally and extend over and above laws governing animal testing and include ongoing independent audits. Only then can they display the Leaping Bunny logo.
