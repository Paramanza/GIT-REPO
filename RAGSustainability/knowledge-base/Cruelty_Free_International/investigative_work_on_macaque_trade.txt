Page Title: investigative work on macaque trade

Bloomberg Investigates’ documentary on the trafficking of monkeys from Cambodia to the United States, has won the 2025 Emmy Award for Outstanding Short Documentary. ‘The Dirty Business of Monkey Laundering’ highlighted the investigation carried out by US government officials into the laundering of wild-caught long-tailed macaques in Cambodia, who were exported to American research laboratories with false paperwork and permits labelled as captive-bred. Our CEO, Michelle Thew, said: “The continued suffering of these intelligent and sentient animals is completely unacceptable. Taking the necessary steps to end the use of primates, and all animals, in research and testing is long overdue.”
