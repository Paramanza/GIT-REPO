We applaud the National Institutes of Healthâ€™s (NIH) decision to stop funding new research grant applications which only use animal testing. The announcement, made by Acting NIH Deputy Director for Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI), Dr. Nicole Kleinstreuer, also confirmed that all new NIH-funded projects must mention non-animal testing methods. This move strongly aligns with elements included in the Humane and Existing Alternatives in Research and Testing Sciences (HEARTS) Act, which would require the agency to incentivize the use of non-animal methods. Cruelty Free International has long championed the HEARTS Act and advocated for many of the changes that the NIH is now pursuing.
