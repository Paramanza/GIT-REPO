Cruelty Free International is the leading organisation working to end animal experiments worldwide. We work to end animal experiments by investigating and exposing the reality of life for animals in laboratories, challenging decision-makers to make a positive difference for animals, and championing better science and cruelty free living. Our experts are available to address issues relating to the use of animals in research and testing, including ethical, scientific and welfare considerations as well as the application of non-animal methods.
