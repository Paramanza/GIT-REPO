Page Title: webinar on animal homing

We highlighted ways to help more animals find loving forever homes or peaceful sanctuary after their use in U.S. laboratories, in a webinar hosted by the American Bar Association. Monicaâ€™s presentation summarized the challenges raised by sanctuaries and rescue organizations. She pointed out specific shortcomings in National Institutes of Health policies that could be limiting the number of animals who are provided an opportunity to have a life beyond the laboratory. The American Bar Association represents the legal profession in the United States and is the largest voluntary professional association in the world.
