Page Title: Certifications for the Textile Sector

We are convinced that the textile-clothing sector has a crucial role to play in integrating better environmental and societal practices, and in contributing to the development of a circular economy that promotes recycling. We work closely with you to tackle these challenges and contribute to the ethical fashion of tomorrow. By operating locally in the main producing countries, we meet the requirements of the globalization of the sector. Ecocert is your reference to ecological and organic labelling. In order to manage your risks and initiate a progress strategy, Ecocert offers recognized standards for organic and ecological textiles, for Fair Trade or for Corporate Social Responsibility.
