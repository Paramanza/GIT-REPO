Page Title: Certifications for the sustainable materials Sector

The Materials sector, with the plastics industry at its head, has a major role to play in developing a circular economy that encourages re-use and recycling in particular. We are at your side to meet this challenge and contribute to a more sustainable materials industry. We encourage the reuse of packaging and the recycling of materials. Ecocert is the benchmark for ecological and organic labelling.
