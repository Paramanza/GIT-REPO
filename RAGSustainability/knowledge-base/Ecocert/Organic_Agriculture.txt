Organic farming is an agricultural production and processing method that combines the best environmental practices with more natural manufacturing processes. Going organic means addressing the basic needs of the population in an innovative and modern way by reconnecting Humans and Nature. Ecocert contributed to the drafting of the first organic regulations and remains an expert sought by French and International authorities.
