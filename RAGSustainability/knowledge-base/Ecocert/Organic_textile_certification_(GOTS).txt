Page Title: Organic textile certification (GOTS)

GOTS certification allows your organic textiles to be commercialized worldwide. GOTS certification guarantees: environmentally friendly production and processing processes, respect and improvement of working conditions, promotion of the use of fibres from organic agriculture, prohibition of hazardous inputs such as toxic heavy metals, aromatic solvents etc. The organic certification through a certification body like Ecocert enables to display the "organic textile" mention in association with the GOTS logo. The marketed products are thus inspected as compliant to the GOTS standard, ensuring a guarantee all through the supply chain until the consumers.
