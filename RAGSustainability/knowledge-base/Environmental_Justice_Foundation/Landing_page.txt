Environmental Justice Foundation | Sustainable Fashion EJF campaigns to reduce the human and environmental costs of the fashion industry and cotton production, exposing human rights abuses, pesticide misuse, water-shortages and calling for supply chain transparency. The clothing industry is one of the greatest polluters on the planet, responsible for around 10% of the worldâ€™s greenhouse gas emissions. Fast fashion means we now produce and throw away more clothes than ever before. In Europe, each individual buys, on average, nearly 15 kg of clothing every year. Worldwide, 87% of discarded textiles are landfilled or incinerated and less than 1% are made into new garments. Synthetic materials dominate textile production, with these non-biodegradable fibres being produced from around 342 million barrels of oil per year and responsible for up to 35% of microplastics found in marine environments. Organic cotton can be a sustainable alternative, but the vast majority of cotton is farmed intensively using harmful pesticides and massive quantities of freshwater. EJF is committed to promoting organic cotton as an environmentally and socially sustainable material, building awareness around the perils of fast fashion and working with partners across the globe to support the transition to a fairer, greener future.
