Environmental Justice Foundation | Climate Our international climate campaign pushes for governments to act quickly and ambitiously to cut carbon emissions, with a target of zero carbon by 2035. We produce compelling films, reports and front-line evidence of the impacts of climate change and offer solutions for how to mitigate them. We promote the protection of the natural ecosystems we need to support to avoid climate catastrophe, and uphold the fundamental principle that everyone should have a safe, sustainable environment in which to live.
