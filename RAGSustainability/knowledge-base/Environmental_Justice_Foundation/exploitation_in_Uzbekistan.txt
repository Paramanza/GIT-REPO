Page Title: exploitation in Uzbekistan

Environmental Justice Foundation | Uncovering exploitation in… EJF first entered Uzbekistan in 2005. What we found there was one of the most exploitative enterprises in the world. Each year, the country’s billion dollar cotton industry was responsible for massive environmental destruction - including the draining of the Aral Sea - and was being propped up by state-controlled forced, child labour. EJF investigators documented children as young as seven handpicking the cotton for days on end; they were doing this not to help their parents’ meagre income on family farms, but because the brutal and corrupt government shut schools across the country and compelled children to labour in the fields. Award-winning investigations in our 2006 report, White Gold: the True Cost of Cotton, and award-winning film of the same name, highlighted the Uzbek government's routine use of forced labour. EJF’s follow-up investigative report, Still in the Fields, revealed that, despite Uzbekistan signing two International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions on child labour, the government was still using child labour in cotton fields. In 2022, the Uzbek Forum for Human Rights released its monitoring report finding no state-imposed forced labour in the 2021 cotton harvest. Although now free of government-imposed child and forced labour, problems persist in Uzbek cotton production. EJF will continue working to secure transparent supply chains and greater support for sustainable fashion.
