Page Title: forests and wetlands

Environmental Justice Foundation | Forests and Wetlands Forests and wetlands sustain our world. They are essential allies in the climate crisis, locking vast amounts of carbon away for centuries. Among the planet’s most diverse ecosystems, forests are home to around 80% of the world’s terrestrial wildlife, and 40% of all plant and animal species depend on wetlands. But both forests and wetlands are being wiped out at an alarming rate. The destruction of forests and wetlands is an affront to the rights of communities that call these ecosystems home. EJF is campaigning to stop this wanton destruction of wetlands and forests, securing protection for the Pantanal in Brazil, the Okavango Delta in Botswana, and Canada’s ancient forests.
