Environmental Justice Foundation | The future of fashion EJF urges buyers to choose their cotton carefully, and calls on manufacturers and retailers to develop transparent product labelling, support a far faster transition to organic cotton production and bring an end to harmful textile production. EJF is encouraging designers and retailers to address human and environmental injustices in our 5 Point Plan to Protect People, Nature and Our Shared World. EJF is calling on the fashion industry to commit to supply chain transparency, traceability and disclosure. Commitment to decarbonising the fashion industry by 2030 by using 100% recycled, organic or regeneratively produced raw materials, phasing out the use of virgin synthetic fibres such as polyester and acrylic, and by switching to renewable energy and sustainable transportation in supply chains. EJF encourages consumers to recognise the power their decisions make in shaping the future of fashion and make clear their expectations of retailers, demanding that they create effective plans to achieve decarbonisation and supply chain transparency.
