Environmental Justice Foundation | Ocean Our global ocean is the ‘blue beating heart’ of our planet. The ocean drives the systems that make our world habitable: regulating climate and temperature, supplying oxygen and clean water, determining weather patterns and precipitation. The ocean keeps our climate stable, absorbing around one-quarter of humanity’s CO2 emissions and 90% of the heat generated from excess greenhouse gas emissions. EJF campaigns to protect the global ocean, its biodiversity and the livelihoods that depend upon it by securing legal, sustainable and equitable fisheries. Our investigations, community monitoring and international collaborations gather the evidence that compel decision makers to act, creating transparency and ending illegal, destructive fisheries.
