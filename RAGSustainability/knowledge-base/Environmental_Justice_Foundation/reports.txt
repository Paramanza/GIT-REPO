Environmental Justice Foundation | Protecting People and Planet This report documents the impacts of overfishing and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in Senegal. It examines how the resulting declines in fish populations are driving increased forced migration to Europe across Earth's most deadly migration route. This briefing finds that a fleet of Chinese tuna fishing vessels operating in the Indian Ocean reportedly used North Koreans as crew, likely violating UN sanctions. This report tells the stories of those on the frontlines of the climate crisis in Dadaab refugee camp, Kenya. These stories highlight the devastating impacts of the drought in the Horn of Africa and the link between global heating and forced displacement.
