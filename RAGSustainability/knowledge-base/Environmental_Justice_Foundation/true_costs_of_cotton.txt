Page Title: true costs of cotton

Environmental Justice Foundation | The true costs of cotton The production of cotton - or White Gold - is a lucrative business. Tens of millions of tonnes of cotton are produced each year for an industry worth billions of dollars. But cotton is also one of the ‘dirtiest’ and ‘thirstiest’ crops on the planet, consuming high levels of pesticides and water. Since 2005, EJF has worked to raise awareness of the environmental and human rights abuses in the global cotton industry. EJF has uncovered the true costs of our global cotton addiction and showcased just how transparency in the supply chain could be achieved. EJF is campaigning for the fashion industry to support the rapid transition to organic cotton as a sustainable and ethical material that supports rural livelihoods and secures a healthy environment.
