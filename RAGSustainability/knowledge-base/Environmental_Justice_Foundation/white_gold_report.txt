Environmental Justice Foundation | White Gold: The True Cost of Cotton This internationally acclaimed report exposes how the billion-dollar cotton industry is causing an environmental catastrophe and human rights abuses in Uzbekistan, Central Asia. White Gold highlights the disastrous demise of the Aral Sea as the rivers that once fed it have been diverted to irrigate cotton fields. The report also draws attention to the endemic use of forced child labour in the annual cotton harvest. Detailed investigations by EJF expose the use of cotton revenues in Uzbekistan to support a corrupt, brutal and coercive dictatorship.
