Page Title: Circular Economy Action Plan

The EU’s circular action plan is paving the way for a cleaner and more competitive Europe. The European Commission adopted the circular economy action plan (CEAP) in March 2020. It is one of the main building blocks of the European Green Deal, Europe’s agenda for sustainable growth. The EU’s transition to a circular economy will reduce pressure on natural resources and will create sustainable growth and jobs. It is also a prerequisite to achieve the EU’s 2050 climate neutrality target and to halt biodiversity loss. The action plan includes initiatives addressing the entire life cycle of products. It targets how products are designed, promotes circular economy processes, encourages sustainable consumption, and aims to ensure that waste is prevented and the resources used are kept in the EU economy for as long as possible.
