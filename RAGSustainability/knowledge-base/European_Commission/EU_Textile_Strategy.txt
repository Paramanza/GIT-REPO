Page Title: EU Textile Strategy

The Strategy aims to create a greener, more competitive sector that is more resistant to global shocks. The Commission's 2030 vision for textiles is that all textile products placed on the EU market are durable, repairable and recyclable, to a great extent made of recycled fibres, free of hazardous substances, produced in respect of social rights and the environment. "fast fashion is out of fashion" and consumers benefit longer from high quality affordable textiles. Profitable re-use and repair services are widely available. The textiles sector is competitive, resilient and innovative with producers taking responsibility for their products along the value chain with sufficient capacities for recycling and minimal incineration and landfilling.
