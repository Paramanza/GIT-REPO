Page Title: Green Claims

The EU is taking action to address greenwashing and protect consumers, and the environment. Ensuring that environmental labels and claims are credible and trustworthy will allow consumers to make better-informed purchasing decisions. It will also boost the competitiveness of businesses striving to increase the environmental sustainability of their products and activities. The proposal on green claims aims to make green claims reliable, comparable and verifiable across the EU, protect consumers from greenwashing, contribute to creating a circular and green EU economy, and help establish a level playing field when it comes to environmental performance of products. In March 2023, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Directive on Green Claims requiring companies to substantiate claims about environmental aspects using robust, science-based and verifiable methods.
