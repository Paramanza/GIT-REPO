Page Title: Sustainable and Circular Textiles Strategy

The Strategy lays out a forward-looking set of actions. The Commission will set design requirements for textiles to make them last longer, easier to repair and recycle, as well as requirements on minimum recycled content. Introduce clearer information and a Digital Product Passport. Reverse overproduction and overconsumption, and discourage the destruction of unsold or returned textiles. Address the unintentional release of microplastics from synthetic textiles. Tackle greenwashing to empower consumers and raise awareness about sustainable fashion. Introduce mandatory and harmonised Extended Producer Responsibility rules for textiles in all Member States and incentivise producers to design products that are more sustainable. Restrict the export of textile waste and promote sustainable textiles globally. Incentivise circular business models, including reuse and repair sectors. Encourage companies and Member States to support the objectives of the Strategy.
