Page Title: Fairtrade International

Fairtrade is about better prices, safe working conditions, local sustainability, and fair terms of trade for farmers and workers. Right now, we’re urging the government to “Brew it Fair” too. We want you to take action and call on the UK Government to ensure the people growing our tea can plan for their futures, and are protected from the impacts of climate change. Together, our actions can have a positive impact on real people’s lives. Fairer pay, fairer treatment, fairer futures – that’s Fairtrade. Buying Fairtrade is easy. There are over 6,000 Fairtrade products from coffee and tea to flowers and gold, so when you shop, look for the FAIRTRADE Mark. There are thousands of Fairtrade groups throughout the UK, including community groups, school groups, universities and places of worship. From coffee mornings to running marathons, supporters across the UK are finding fun and creative ways to raise money for Fairtrade. Join the Fairtrade community and help us campaign for fairer trade, climate justice and a better future. Fairtrade adds Türkiye to its list of producer countries.
