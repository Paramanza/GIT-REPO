“Making fanzines was something we had always wanted to do, so when the occasion arose we jumped at it wholeheartedly. For a creative campaign such as ours, the medium is ideal as it can convey complicated messages in a visual way, without taking anything away from the rigour of the conversation. Each zine has its own identity which also to me reiterates how the multiple issues we tackle are so different, and have a different set of solutions.” Orsola De Castro
