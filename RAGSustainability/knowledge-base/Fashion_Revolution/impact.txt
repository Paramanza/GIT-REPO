Page Title: impact

Our team works tirelessly to advocate for tougher legislation, legally binding agreements and policy transformation to hold the fashion industry accountable. For example, our work campaigning for a renewed International Accord on health and safety was successful in encouraging brands to keep their garment workers safe in Bangladesh and beyond.
