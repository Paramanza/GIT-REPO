Sewing the Seeds explores fashion activism through articles, photography and illustrations created by the Leeds Beckett University students & staff, and designers, makers & innovators around the north of England. We extend our appreciation to Leeds Beckett University for making this project possible through their financial support and the content created by their talented and passionate students. It’s a big, colourful issue — with 112 pages of articles, illustration & photography, and packed with new perspectives, tips and interviews with innovators in circular and sustainable fashion design.
