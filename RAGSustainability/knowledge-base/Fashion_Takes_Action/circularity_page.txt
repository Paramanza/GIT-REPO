Page Title: circularity page

Circularity is a necessity for individuals and businesses alike in fashion. Circular fashion reimagines the design, production, and usage of clothing to eliminate waste and extend the life of materials. It prioritizes durability, reuse, and responsible recycling, which subsequently reduces landfill waste and carbon emissions. Circular fashion also serves as a smart business strategy, creating new revenue streams and job opportunities while promoting social equity.
