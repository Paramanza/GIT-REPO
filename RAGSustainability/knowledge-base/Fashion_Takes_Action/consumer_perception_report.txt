Page Title: consumer perception report

More and more citizens want sustainable fashion — but how can they tell what’s genuine and what’s just greenwashing? At Fashion Takes Action, we’ve spent the past 18 years advancing sustainability through education, collaboration, and research, but the industry’s environmental impact remains staggering. Our findings shed light on the gap between perception and reality, and offer actionable insights to support policy change, empower consumers, and hold brands accountable. This national study explores Canadian consumer perceptions of sustainability and greenwashing in the fashion industry, including awareness and understanding of greenwashing, trust in sustainability claims, and behavioral responses to greenwashing. Key findings show that 64% of respondents would stop buying from brands caught greenwashing and that 79% express frustration with it.
