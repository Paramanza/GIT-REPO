Fashion Takes Action sees an opportunity to reshape Canada's fashion industry as part of a bold vision outlined in the Prime Ministerâ€™s mandate letter, aiming for a cleaner, equitable economy and addressing pressing challenges such as climate change and social justice. Our Canadian Circular Textiles Consortium seeks to create circular systems for reuse, repair, and recycling, while also scaling education and training for meaningful careers within a sustainable fashion context.
