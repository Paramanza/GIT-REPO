The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) was developed by leading standard setters to define world-wide recognised requirements for organic textiles. From the harvesting of the raw materials, environmentally and socially responsible manufacturing to labelling, textiles certified to GOTS provide a credible assurance to the consumer. The Public Consultation for the New Global Responsible Textile Standard (GRTS) is Open. GOTS Version 7.0 was found to demonstrate close alignment with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector. GOTS 2024 Annual Report reveals key achievements and strategic shifts. The GOTS certification process starts at the processing level (e.g., ginning mills for cotton).
