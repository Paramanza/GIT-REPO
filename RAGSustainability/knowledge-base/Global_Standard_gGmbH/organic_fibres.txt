Page Title: organic fibres

Organic fibres have emerged as a vital component, enabling an industry that proactively reduces its negative environmental impact and prioritises human well-being over short-term gains. To carry the ‘made with organic’ label grade, a textile product must contain a minimum of 70% certified organic fibres, while the 'organic' label grade requires a minimum of 95% certified organic fibres.
