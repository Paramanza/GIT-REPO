Page Title: traceability

Traceability is the possibility to identify and follow the path of a product as it moves through the value chain, from the origin of its raw materials to the point of final delivery to the end consumer. GOTS guarantees an independent and gapless verification of a traceable and comprehensively certified product flow.
