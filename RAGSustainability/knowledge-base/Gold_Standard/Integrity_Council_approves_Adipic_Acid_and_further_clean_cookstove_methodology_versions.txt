announcement UPDATED Jun 4, 2025 Integrity Council approves Adipic Acid and further clean cookstove methodology versions 3 June 2025 – Gold Standard is pleased to share that the Integrity Council (ICVCM) has approved versions 2, 3, and 3.1 of our clean cooking and heating methodology (TPDDTEC) as meeting its Core Carbon Principles (CCPs) —provided certain conditions are met. ICVCM’s latest recognition highlights the strong track record and credibility of the methodologies used by hundreds of clean cooking projects under Gold Standard. It also opens the door for more projects to earn the CCP label for future carbon credit issuances under their existing methodology. It follows ICVCM’s earlier approval in February 2025 of version 4 of the TPDDTEC methodology, along with our approaches for Metered & Measured Cooking Devices and Animal Manure Management and Biogas Use for Thermal Energy—again, subject to specific conditions. In April, Gold Standard published clear requirement for projects aiming to label their GS-VERs as CCP-compliant and we are already working with project developers to help them apply these requirements and move forward with clean cooking initiatives. Following the ICVCM decision, we will publish the updated version of requirements with further details for V2, 3, and 3.1 in the coming weeks.
