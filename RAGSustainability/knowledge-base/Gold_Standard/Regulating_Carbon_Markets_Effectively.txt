Page Title: Regulating Carbon Markets Effectively

report UPDATED Apr 16, 2025 Regulating Carbon Markets Effectively Drawing from over two decades as a leading crediting programme with projects in over 100 countries, Gold Standard has developed nine factsheets offering guidance and insights for policy makers considering national regulations Download Report Driven by a combination of factors, new regulatory efforts spanning multiple fronts are increasingly being developed by governments globally, with a significant increase in the number of carbon credit mechanism related regulations. But policymakers do not have to start from scratch – there is a global landscape of carbon market standards, projects and intermediary services to learn from. Drawing from over two decades as a leading crediting programme with projects in over 100 countries, Gold Standard has developed nine factsheets offering guidance and insights for policy makers considering national regulations. The resource has been designed to support policymakers considering government action related to carbon credits markets, and more specifically action that related to carbon crediting programmes and projects registered with these programmes. The factsheets are focused primarily on areas where governments may choose to regulate or otherwise take action in relation to projects registered under carbon crediting programmes, including credit use cases and relationship to NDCs, dual certification, and using crediting programmes on the Article 6.2. These factsheets were developed under the Enabling National Ownership in a High-Integrity Carbon Market programme supported by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action of Germany (BMWK) Partner Programme Regulating Carbon Markets Effectively - Introduction Introduction Factsheet 1 - Programme-level Integrity FACTsheet 1 Factsheet 2 - Methodologies in Local Contexts Factsheet 2 Factsheet 3 - Inclusivity, Safeguards and Benefit Sharing Factsheet 3 Factsheet 4 - Sustainable Development Factsheet 4 Factsheet 5 - Registries and Project Information Factsheet 5 Factsheet 6 - Claims and Relationship to NDCs Factsheet 6 Factsheet 7 - Using Crediting Programmes under Article 6.2 Factsheet 7 Factsheet 8 - Dual Certification Factsheet 8 Factsheet 9 - Taxes and Fees on Carbon Credits Factsheet 9 Gold Standard Newsletter Subscription Stay updated on our latest news and more. submit International Environment House II Chemin de Balexert 7-9 1219 Châtelaine, Switzerland Inform News FAQs Events Newsletters Explore Impact Registry Standard Documents SDG Impact Dashboard SDG Impact Tool Gold Standard Marketplace Assurance Platform Engage Contact Donate Consultations Work with us © Gold Standard 2025 Terms and Conditions Privacy Notice Conflict of Interest Policy Cookie Policy
