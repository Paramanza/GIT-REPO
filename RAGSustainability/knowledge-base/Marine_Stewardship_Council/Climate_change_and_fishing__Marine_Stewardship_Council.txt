Page Title: Climate change and fishing | Marine Stewardship Council

Climate change is having a profound impact on our oceans and marine life. Its effects are changing the distribution of fish stocks and their food. Given their importance to the planet, it's vital we manage the oceans in a sustainable way. Changes to the ocean mean changes to fish stocks. In the past 30 years, marine heatwaves are estimated to have increased by more than 50%.
