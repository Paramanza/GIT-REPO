Page Title: Fisheries improving | Marine Stewardship Council

Fisheries don’t stop improving once they become MSC certified. They make a long-term commitment to sustainability and to keep up with global best practice. To be certified as sustainable, fisheries must score an average of at least 80 out of 100 for each of the MSC Fisheries Standard’s three principles: sustainable stocks, environmental impacts and effective management. Completing one condition can lead to a wide range of improvements. By March 2024, MSC certified fisheries had recorded over 2,362 different improvements.
