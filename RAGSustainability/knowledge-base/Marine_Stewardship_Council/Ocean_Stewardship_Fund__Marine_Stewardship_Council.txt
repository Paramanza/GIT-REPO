Page Title: Ocean Stewardship Fund | Marine Stewardship Council

Since its creation in 2019, The MSCâ€™s Ocean Stewardship Fund has awarded $8.8million to support over 200 fisheries and projects worldwide. The Ocean Stewardship Fund (OSF) provides grants for fishery improvements and funds important research into bycatch reduction, protecting marine habitats, and the effects of climate change. We commit 5% of annual royalties from MSC certified product sales to the fund and combine these with third-party donations. Since 2020, over $6.6 million has been dedicated to 144 diverse fisheries and projects through OSF grants.
