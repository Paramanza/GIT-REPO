Page Title: The MSC's collective impact | Marine Stewardship Council

For 25 years fisheries, scientists, consumers and industry have been part of a collective effort to make sure our oceans are fished sustainably. Since we were founded in 1997, fisheries responsible for 16.5% of marine catch have been certified to the MSC Fisheries Standard. Certification is helping to grow and maintain the number of sustainable fish populations. To remain certified, fisheries have so far made over 2,300 improvements to their performance and management. More than 48,000 sites, including supermarket chains, restaurants, fishmongers and hotels are now certified to sell seafood with the blue MSC label.
