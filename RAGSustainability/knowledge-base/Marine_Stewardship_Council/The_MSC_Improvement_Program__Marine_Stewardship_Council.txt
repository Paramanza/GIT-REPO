Page Title: The MSC Improvement Program | Marine Stewardship Council

The necessity for well-managed fisheries is more urgent than ever and progress needs to be rapid. Fisheries not yet operating at a level that meets the MSC Standard can join the MSC Improvement Program. Fisheries in the Program are expected to improve stock management and environmental impacts so they can meet the Fisheries Standard within five years.
