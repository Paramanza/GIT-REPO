Page Title: What Is Overfishing | Marine Stewardship Council

Overfishing is a serious global problem that threatens ocean wildlife and biodiversity. Loss of marine life brings a further threat to the millions of people who rely on seafood for protein and livelihoods. Overfishing occurs when too many fish in a particular stock are caught and there are not enough adults to breed and sustain a healthy population. The level of overfishing has been increasing in recent decades and the number of overfished stocks is now three times higher than in 1970.
