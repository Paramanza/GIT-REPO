Page Title: JUSTIFICATION

Fashion retailers largely operate in a regulatory vacuum. Currently there are no legally binding environmental standards placed on the apparel and footwear industries. As a result, "fast fashion" retailers and manufacturers may ramp up production and operations without taking environmental or social sustainability into account. Apparel and footwear are responsible for a massive part of the climate crisis causing greenhouse gas emissions, between 4-8.6% of the world's global greenhouse gas footprint.
