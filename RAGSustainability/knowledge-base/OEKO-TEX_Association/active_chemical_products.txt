Page Title: active chemical products

Active chemical products (ACPs) are modified polymers, preparations and chemical substances used in the textile industry. ACPs are either already integrated in fibre production or added during a later phase of textile manufacture. OEKO-TEX® differentiates mainly between biologically active substances / biocides and flame-retardant substances. The use of active chemical products (ACPs) is generally forbidden for textiles certified in accordance with OEKO-TEX®. Listed ACPs may be certified in accordance with the OEKO-TEX® ECO PASSPORT. OEKO-TEX® reserves the right to remove ACPs from the list if new scientific findings should prove that health safety is no longer guaranteed. OEKO-TEX® only includes ACPs if they have been checked by accredited toxicologists and assessed as being harmless to human health.
