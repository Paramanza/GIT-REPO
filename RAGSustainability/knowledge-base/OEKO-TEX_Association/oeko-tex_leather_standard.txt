OEKO-TEX® LEATHER STANDARD: leather you can trust. Whether shoes, clothes, accessories or sofas, an item bearing the OEKO-TEX® LEATHER STANDARD label is a better and safer choice. Leather that meets this standard has been scientifically tested for harmful substances. The more intensive the skin contact is, the stricter are the human ecology requirements for the OEKO-TEX® LEATHER STANDARD laboratory tests.
