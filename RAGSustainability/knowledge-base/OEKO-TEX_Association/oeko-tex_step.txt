OEKO-TEX® STeP certification sets the highest standards for both social and environmental aspects of textile and leather production, as well as for industrial laundries. This certification is a sign of responsibility towards employees and the environment, and supports a company’s journey towards more sustainable production. STeP audits assess important areas of a facility using 6 modules: chemical management, environmental performance, environmental management, social responsibility, quality management, health & safety. The certification includes the Impact Calculator, a tool which calculates the carbon and water footprint of a facility and shows where proactive measures can be initiated to reduce the industry’s environmental footprint.
