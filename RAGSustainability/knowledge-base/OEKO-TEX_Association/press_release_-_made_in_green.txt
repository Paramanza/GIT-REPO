Page Title: press release - made in green

SPOOR achieves OEKO-TEX® MADE IN GREEN for hides with farm-to-product traceability. Through this partnership, the two organisations will drive forward a data-based approach that enables full traceability of leather products back to the individual animal farm, setting a new global standard for responsible sourcing. This traceability data is subsequently digitized within the OEKO-TEX® Label Check, allowing consumers to effortlessly access and visualize the locations and stages immediately.
