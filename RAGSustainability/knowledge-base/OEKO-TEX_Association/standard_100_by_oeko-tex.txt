Page Title: standard 100 by oeko-tex

OEKO-TEXÂ® STANDARD 100 is a label for textiles tested for harmful substances. It sets the benchmark for textile safety, from yarn to finished product. Every item bearing the STANDARD 100 label is certified as having passed safety tests for the presence of harmful substances. The certified article is harmless to human health; every thread, button and accessory have been tested against a list of over 1,000 harmful substances. The more intensive the skin contact, the stricter the human ecology requirements and laboratory tests. We use globally standardised test criteria. The certification complies with international requirements and regulations.
