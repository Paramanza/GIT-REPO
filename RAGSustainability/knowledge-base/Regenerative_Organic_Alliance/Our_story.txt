Page Title: Our story

Regenerative Organic Certified was established in 2017 by the Regenerative Organic Alliance(ROA), a group of farmers, business leaders, and experts in soil health, animal welfare, and social fairness. We exist to heal a broken system, repair a damaged planet, and empower farmers and eaters to create a better future through regenerative organic farming. Regenerative Organic Certification recognizes the strong work already conducted by existing animal welfare and social fairness standard bodies and therefore leverages this work as part of the journey to Regenerative Organic Certification.
