Page Title: Why Regenerative Organic?

Growing food and fiber through industrial methods has devastated our soil and climate. With regenerative organic agriculture, we can rehabilitate soil, respect animal welfare, and improve the lives of farmers. Regenerative organic agriculture is a collection of practices that focus on regenerating soil health and the full farm ecosystem. Soil is the bedrock of our food system and, ultimately, our culture and civilization.
