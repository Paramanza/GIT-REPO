Page Title: FairCapacity Program - SAI

The FairCapacity Program aims to improve production capacity measurement and forecasting practices to reflect the true costs of production and incentivize good purchasing practices to relieve unrealistic time and price pressures, often unfairly borne by workers. Poor production capacity calculations exacerbate issues like excessive overtime, non-payment of overtime wages, and unsafe working conditions. FairCapacity aims to address these problems through a comprehensive program to quantify the impacts of purchasing practices on supplier production capacity.
