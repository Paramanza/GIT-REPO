Page Title: International Recruitment Integrity System (IRIS) - SAI

The International Recruitment Integrity System (IRIS) is a social compliance scheme designed to promote ethical international recruitment. It was created by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in collaboration with a consortium of partners, including SAI. IRIS works by defining and setting a benchmark for ethical recruitment (the IRIS Standard), and through establishing a voluntary certification scheme for legal private labor recruitment agencies, and a compliance and monitoring mechanism. The goal of IRIS is to transform the international recruitment industry to make it fair for workers, recruiters, and employers. It does this by promoting the Employer Pays Principle, promoting greater transparency within international recruitment, and promoting the rights of migrant workers.
