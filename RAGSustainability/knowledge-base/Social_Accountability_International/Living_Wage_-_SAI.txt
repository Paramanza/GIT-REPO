Page Title: Living Wage - SAI

A living wage meets a workerâ€™s basic needs to maintain a safe, decent standard of living for themselves and their family. SAI has included payment of a living wage as one of its core principles for decent work since its founding. SAI works across all programs to advance decent wages and promote decent work, offering wage gap assessments and support for implementing living wage strategies.
