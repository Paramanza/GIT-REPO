Page Title: Palma Futuro - SAI

Palma Futuro aims to build up robust social performance systems that improve conditions for workers at every level of the palm oil supply chain in Colombia and Ecuadorâ€”from industrial processing plants to large-scale plantations and smallholder farms. The program provides technical guidance to assist participating companies in assessing their risk of child labor, forced labor, and unacceptable working conditions. It will also share best practices and lessons learned with the larger South American and global palm oil industries.
