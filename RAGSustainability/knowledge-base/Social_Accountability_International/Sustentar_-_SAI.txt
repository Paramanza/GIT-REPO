Project to Build and Strengthen Sustainability Systems in the Tomato & Chile Sectors in Mexico. Our Approach is enabling good labor practices through strong management systems—supported by worker voice and engagement with communities and stakeholders. Objectives include increased compliance with labor laws related to child labor, forced labor, and acceptable conditions of work, and better implementation of compliance systems by private sector stakeholders. Outcomes include increased understanding of USMCA’s labor standards and improved integration of core labor standards into agricultural social compliance systems.
