Combining trees with crops or livestock is more productive, better for wildlife and healthier for the planet, but only 3% of the UKâ€™s farmland currently practices agroforestry. Agroforestry is the practice of combining agricultural crops or livestock with trees and shrubs. Research has revealed that it can enhance farm productivity, increase wildlife, improve soil health and animal welfare, and manage water flow.
