Page Title: Climate change

We can change our climate for the better by adapting the way we farm and eat. It is estimated that as much as one third of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from food and farming. Research shows that if all of Europeâ€™s farmland followed organic principles, agricultural emissions across the continent could drop by 40 - 50% by 2050.
