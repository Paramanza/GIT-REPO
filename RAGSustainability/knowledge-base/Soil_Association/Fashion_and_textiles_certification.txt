Fashion and Textiles Organic Certification. Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certification with Soil Association Certification ensures that at least 70 percent of the product is made up of certified organic material. The textiles industry sees a lot of exploitation; however, GOTS is the only standard to cover environmental, social, and chemical requirements throughout the supply chain.
