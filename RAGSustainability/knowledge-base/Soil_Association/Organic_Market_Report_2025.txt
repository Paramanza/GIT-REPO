Page Title: Organic Market Report 2025

Organic has bounced back from the cost-of-living crisis with growth exceeding non-organic. The market grew 7.3% in 2024 ending the year at £3.7 billion – double what it was 10 years ago. Organic unit sales grew four-times more than non-organic in major retail. Consumer support for organic has remained strong despite the cost-of-living crisis, as shoppers look for certified sustainable, high-quality products. Organic farming remains stuck on 3% of UK farmland – with the market heavily reliant on imports.
