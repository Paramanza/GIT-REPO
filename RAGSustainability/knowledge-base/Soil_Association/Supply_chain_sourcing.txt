Page Title: Supply chain sourcing

Whether you're a producer, processor or distributor we can help with your supply chain needs. We believe that sustainable supply chains are key to helping ensure continued sector growth. We support organic businesses by developing dedicated help with understanding regulations around importing into the UK and accessing new and emerging sectors with your organic offer. From the 1st January 2021, several things changed for organic farmers and growers, manufacturers and traders importing into the UK. We have compiled some key information for organic businesses who import product into the UK. Our Food for Life Served Here and Organic Served Here awards are opening opportunities for suppliers of organic products and ingredients.
