Page Title: Sustainable Food Places

Through the power of partnerships, we aim to make healthy and sustainable food a defining characteristic of where people live. Since 2013, the Sustainable Food Places programme has been the driving force behind the UKâ€™s rapidly growing place-based food partnership movement. Food partnerships bring together people from across the food system. This includes local authorities, community and voluntary sector organisations, farmers and local businesses.
