Page Title: What are organic standards?

What are organic standards? Next time you visit a supermarket, take a look at the food labels. You'll see plenty of claims about sustainability and welfare, but amongst them, the organic logo stands out as the only one underpinned by law. All organic food and drink sold in the EU must meet the EU Organic Regulation - shown by the green leaf logo on pack. When the United Kingdom left the European Union (EU), we retained organic food, feed and farming regulations within Great Britain. The current arrangement sees licensees based within Northern Ireland remained certified to the EU organic regulation. Soil Association certified products must legally comply with organic regulations retained in Great Britain, and to feature the Soil Association logo they must also meet our additional higher standards. Standards put our principles into practice and are at the heart of our work. The Soil Association wants to ensure the highest possible standards of animal welfare, environmental and wildlife protection, so we have our own higher – or stricter – standards in key areas. Organic food is certified - an independent guarantee. All organic food sold in the EU has to be certified by registered certification bodies. Soil Association Certification Limited is the UK’s largest and oldest organic certification body, licensing over 70% of the organic food on sale here.
