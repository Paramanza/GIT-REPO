Page Title: Brand Partner Profile: Reda

Over 20 years ago, Reda made the conscious decision to use sustainability to guide their business decisions. This has helped them stand out as the first woolen mill to be awarded several prestigious international certifications. Reda takes a three-dimensional approach to sustainability; economic, environmental, and social. Reda first started using ZQ merino in 2009, ZQ ensures economic, social, and environmental sustainability, fibre quality and full traceability of woolâ€™s journey from the farm through to the woollen mill. Reda has applied this approach through their value chain, from raw material to the finished product, with complete traceability of the entire production chain.
