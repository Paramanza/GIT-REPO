Page Title: Brand Partner Profile: Smalls Merino

Smalls Merino launched in Selfridges London in 2014 with a mission to re-imagine the way we wear wool. Sustainability and traceability have always been at the core of everything they do, and for that reason they have always exclusively used 100% ZQ Merino. Our desire to connect back to our homeland, the farms and the sheep, and our customers connection to us and our brand story gives them a stronger appreciation for the whole picture, truly knowing where your wool comes from, and who made it into beautiful garments.
