The world's leading ethical wool. ZQ is a wool certification standard that stands for a better quality of life. For the animals, for our planet, our people, and you. ZQRX takes a big picture view of the global challenges and solving them by accelerating small, collective, regenerative-driven actions. We are one of the largest global suppliers of RWS certified wool. ZQ is the 'zen balance' between IQ and EQ. Science and technology create a better way of farming (the IQ). Equally as important are the connections and relationships with our land, animals and people (EQ).
