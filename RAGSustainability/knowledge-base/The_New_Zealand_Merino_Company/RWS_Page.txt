As global leaders in ethical wool production, the team at The New Zealand Merino Company was proud to work with Textile Exchange in the development of the Responsible Wool Standard (RWS) as we share common goals with respect to transparency and animal welfare. The RWS was developed through an open and transparent process led by Textile Exchange and a multi-stakeholder group.
