Page Title: Traceability Page

Traditionally, farmers sold their wool at auction with no knowledge of where it went or what it was to be used for. With ZQ, our growers are connected to the brands that buy their wool, and theyâ€™re proud to wear and use the products. ZQ Natural Fibre is fully traceable back to the individual farms the fibre is blended from, connecting ZQ products to the people behind it and giving you confidence in the integrity of the fibre.
