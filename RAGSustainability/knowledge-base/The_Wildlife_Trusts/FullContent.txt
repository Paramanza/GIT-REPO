re at risk of flooding. Nature-based solutions such as restoring wetlands, creating buffer zones, and implementing sustainable land management practices can significantly reduce flood risk. By restoring natural processes, we can enhance the ability of the landscape to absorb excess rainwater and slow down the flow of water into vulnerable areas. This not only protects our communities and infrastructure but also contributes to biodiversity, providing habitats for wildlife and improving the health of ecosystems. Integrating these solutions into our planning and development processes is essential to building resilience against flooding and the effects of climate change.
