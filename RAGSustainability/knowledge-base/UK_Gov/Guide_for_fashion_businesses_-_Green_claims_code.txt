Page Title: Guide for fashion businesses - Green claims code

Fashion customers are increasingly demanding products and services that do less harm to or benefit the environment. It’s important that they can make informed choices based on claims they can trust. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has published this guide to help fashion businesses stay on the right side of consumer law. Drawing on lessons from our recent investigation into ASOS, Boohoo and George at Asda, we explain how you can follow the Green Claims Code when making environmental (or ‘green’) claims. This guide focuses on retailers but is also relevant to those who manufacture or distribute products. Wherever you are in the supply chain, you’re responsible for making sure your claims are accurate and backed up. If you don’t, you risk breaking the law, having to pay back your customers, and significant harm to your business’s reputation. All your green claims must be clear and accurate. This is the case whether they’re made on a product (including on labels), in advertising, in store or online. Don’t hide important information. Instead: use plain language, make it clearly visible, present in a way that customers can easily understand, put it close to the green claim you make. Customers should not have to do something, like follow a hyperlink or scan a QR code, to find this information. It should be on the same side of a tag, or next to a claim on a website. It shouldn’t contradict the claim either. Avoid using unclear terms like ‘green’, ‘sustainable’ or ‘eco-friendly’. They’re more likely to mislead customers into thinking that the product as a whole has a positive impact on the environment (or not a negative one, at least), which might not be true.
