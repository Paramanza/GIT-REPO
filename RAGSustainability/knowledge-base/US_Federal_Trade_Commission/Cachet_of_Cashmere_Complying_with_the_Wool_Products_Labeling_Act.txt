Page Title: Cachet of Cashmere: Complying with the Wool Products Labeling Act

The ultra-fine wool, from the undercoat of the Cashmere (or Kashmir) goat, is indeed a premium fiber that generally commands a much higher price than sheep's wool. If you manufacture or sell clothing or household items that contain any wool, including specialty wools like cashmere, you must comply with the Wool Products Labeling Act. That means your product labels must accurately reflect the items' fiber content, the country of origin, and either the name or registered identification number (RN or WPL number) issued by the FTC to the manufacturer or marketer.
