Page Title: Environmental Claims: Summary of the Green Guides

Marketers should not make broad, unqualified general environmental benefit claims like "green" or "eco-friendly." Broad claims are difficult to substantiate, if not impossible. Marketers should qualify general claims with specific environmental benefits. Marketers should have competent and reliable scientific evidence to support carbon offset claims. When marketers claim a product is compostable, they need competent and reliable scientific evidence that all materials in the product or package will break down into usable compost safely and in about the same time as the materials with which it is composted.
